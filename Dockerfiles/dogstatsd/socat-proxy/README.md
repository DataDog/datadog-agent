# UDP -> Unix Domain Socket proxy for DogStatsD

This docker image runs a simple UDP -> UDS proxy with `socat`, to help with the transition to the Unix Domain Socket protocol if your client libraries are not patched yet. It is intended to be run as a sidecar container for your application and will forward UDP packets sent to `localhost:8125` to `/socket/statsd.socket`.

To run it, you need to:

  - expose the dogstatsd socket path to `/socket/statsd.socket` (for example `-v /var/run/datadog/:/socket:ro`)
  - run the container with `--autorestart ALWAYS`, as `socat` will exit on write errors. Please note that packets will be dropped while the container is restarting.

This is an example Kubernetes spec:
