# Kubernetes apiserver integration
#
# When running in a pod, the agent will automatically use the pod's serviceaccount
# to authenticate with the apiserver. If you wish to install the agent out of a pod
# or customise connection parameters, you can provide the path to a KubeConfig file
# see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/
#
# kubernetes_kubeconfig_path: /path/to/file
#
# In order to collect Kubernetes service names, the agent needs certain rights (see RBAC documentation in
# [docker readme](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/Dockerfiles/agent/README.md#kubernetes)).
# You can disable this option or set how often (in seconds) the agent refreshes the internal mapping of metadata (including service names) to
# ContainerIDs with the following options:
# kubernetes_collect_metadata_tags: true
# kubernetes_metadata_tag_update_freq: 300
#
#
# To collect Kubernetes events, leader election must be enabled and collect_kubernetes_events set to true.
# Only the leader will collect events. More details about events [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/Dockerfilesagent/README.md#event-collection).
# collect_kubernetes_events: false
#
#
# Leader Election settings, more details about leader election [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/Dockerfilesagent/README.md#leader-election)
# To enable the leader election on this node, set the leader_election variable to true.
# leader_election: false
# The leader election lease is an integer in seconds.
# leader_lease_duration: 60
