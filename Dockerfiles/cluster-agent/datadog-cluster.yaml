# If you need a proxy to connect to the Internet, provide it here (default:
# disabled). You can use the 'no_proxy' list to specify hosts that should
# bypass the proxy. These settings might impact your checks requests, please
# refer to the specific check documentation for more details. Environment
# variables HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (coma-separated string) will
# override the values set here. See https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/proxy/.
#
# proxy:
#   http: http(s)://user:password@proxy_for_http:port
#   https: http(s)://user:password@proxy_for_https:port
#   no_proxy:
#     - host1
#     - host2

# Setting this option to "yes" will tell the agent to skip validation of SSL/TLS certificates.
# This may be necessary if the agent is running behind a proxy. See this page for details:
# https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Proxy-Configuration#using-haproxy-as-a-proxy
# skip_ssl_validation: no

# Setting this option to "yes" will force the agent to only use TLS 1.2 when
# pushing data to the url specified in "dd_url".
# force_tls_12: no

# Force the hostname to whatever you want. (default: auto-detected)
# hostname: mymachine.mydomain

# Make the agent use "hostname -f" on unix-based systems as a last resort
# way of determining the hostname instead of Golang "os.Hostname()"
# This will be enabled by default in version 6.4
# More information at  https://dtdg.co/flag-hostname-fqdn
# hostname_fqdn: false

# Set the host's tags (optional)
# tags:
#   - mytag
#   - env:prod
#   - role:database

# Histogram and Historate configuration
#
# Configure which aggregated value to compute. Possible values are: min, max,
# median, avg, sum and count.
#
# histogram_aggregates: ["max", "median", "avg", "count"]
#
# Configure which percentiles will be computed. Must be a list of float
# between 0 and 1.
# Warning: percentiles must be specified as yaml strings

# Copy histogram values to distributions for true global distributions (in beta)
# This will increase the number of custom metrics created

# Forwarder timeout in seconds
# forwarder_timeout: 20

# The forwarder retries failed requests. Use this setting to change the
# maximum length of the forwarder's retry queue (each request in the queue
# takes no more than 2MB in memory)
# forwarder_retry_queue_max_size: 30

# The number of workers used by the forwarder. Please note each worker will
# open an outbound HTTP connection towards Datadog's metrics intake at every

# Logging
#

# log_file: /var/log/datadog/agent.log

# Set to 'yes' to output logs in JSON format
# log_format_json: no

# Set to 'no' to disable logging to stdout

# Set to 'yes' to disable logging to the log file
# disable_file_logging: no

# Set to 'yes' to enable logging to syslog.
#
# log_to_syslog: no
#
# If 'syslog_uri' is left undefined/empty, a local domain socket connection will be attempted
#
# syslog_uri:
#
# Set to 'yes' to output in an RFC 5424-compliant format
#
# syslog_rfc: no
#
# If TLS enabled, you must specify a path to a PEM certificate here
#
# syslog_pem: /path/to/certificate.pem
#
# If TLS enabled, you must specify a path to a private key here

# If TLS enabled, you may enforce TLS verification here (defaults to true) 
#
# syslog_tls_verify: yes 
#

# Kubernetes apiserver integration
#
# When running in a pod, the agent will automatically use the pod's serviceaccount
# to authenticate with the apiserver. If you wish to install the agent out of a pod
# or customise connection parameters, you can provide the path to a KubeConfig file
# see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/
#
# kubernetes_kubeconfig_path: /path/to/file
#
# In order to collect Kubernetes service names, the agent needs certain rights (see RBAC documentation in
# [docker readme](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/Dockerfiles/agent/README.md#kubernetes)).
# You can disable this option or set how often (in seconds) the agent refreshes the internal mapping of services to
# ContainerIDs with the following options:
# kubernetes_collect_metadata_tags: true
# kubernetes_metadata_tag_update_freq: 300
#
#
# To collect Kubernetes events, leader election must be enabled and collect_kubernetes_events set to true.
# Only the leader will collect events. More details about events [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/Dockerfilesagent/README.md#event-collection).
# collect_kubernetes_events: false
#
#
# Leader Election settings, more details about leader election [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/Dockerfilesagent/README.md#leader-election)
# To enable the leader election on this node, set the leader_election variable to true.
# leader_election: false
# The leader election lease is an integer in seconds.
# leader_lease_duration: 60
#
# Node labels that should be collected and their name in host tags. Off by default.
# Some of these labels are redundant with metadata collected by
# cloud provider crawlers (AWS, GCE, Azure)
#
# kubernetes_node_labels_as_tags:
#   kubernetes.io/hostname: nodename
#   beta.kubernetes.io/os: os
