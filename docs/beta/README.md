# Datadog Agent 6 Beta

## What is Agent 6?

Agent 6 is the latest major version of the Datadog Agent. The big difference
between Agent 5 and Agent 6 is that Agent 6 is a complete rewrite of the core
Agent in Golang. Donâ€™t worry! We still support Python checks.

## Anything important to know before joining the beta?

You should look at the [changes and deprecations document][changes] and the
[known issues document][known-issues], to see if anything you rely upon is listed
in there.

## How do I join the beta?

The beta is open for everyone! Take a look at the document about how to
[install the agent][upgrade] and you'll be ready to go.

## That was cool, but I need to go back to `stable`

We've tried to keep it easy and straight-forward to downgrade back to
agent 5 until things are more mature for you on agent 6.

Please check out our [downgrade guide][downgrade] for instructions on
how to get back on the `stable` agent 5 repo.
