# Known Issues

There are some issues with the Beta Agent. We apologize for this, but it is a beta. This document will be updated as these issues are resolved.

## Checks

The Docker and Kubernetes checks do not work properly. Do not use them or rely upon them.

## Systems

We do not yet build packages for the full gamut of systems that Agent 5 targets. While some are being dropped as unsupported, others are simply not yet supported.

CentOS 5 is not supported.
We are not yet building a package to target SUSE Enterprise Linux.
