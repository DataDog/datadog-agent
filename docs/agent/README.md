## What is Agent 6?

Agent 6 is the latest major version of the Datadog Agent. The big difference
between Agent 5 and Agent 6 is that Agent 6 is a complete rewrite of the core
Agent in Golang. Don’t worry! We still support Python checks.

## Installation and management

To install the Agent you can either upgrade from an older version, or start
fresh with a new installation - in both cases, please refer to the [official
documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) for your system. If you want to go back to
version 5.x, please follow the instructions about [how to downgrade][downgrade].

There are a number of differences between the old major version of the Agent and
the new one, please refer to:
* [the doc on the general Agent changes][changes]
* [the doc on the differences in the Agent config options][config]
* [the list of Agent 5 features that are not ported to Agent 6][missing-features]
