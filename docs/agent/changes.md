# Changes and Deprecations

Datadog Agent 6 contains a large number of changes. While we attempted to make it
a drop in replacement, there were a small number of deprecations or changes in
behavior which will be listed in this document.
For a list of features that haven't been ported, see [this doc](missing_features.md).

Note: If you see anything that's incorrect about this document, do not hesitate to

## Configuration Files

Prior releases of Datadog Agent stored configuration files in `/etc/dd-agent`.
Starting with the 6.0 release configuration files will now be stored in
`/etc/datadog-agent`.

In addition to the location change, the primary agent configuration file has been
transitioned from INI format to YAML to better support complex configurations and
for a more consistent experience across the Agent and the Checks; as such `datadog.conf`
is now retired in favor of `datadog.yaml`.

To automatically transition between agent configuration paths and formats, you
may use the agent command: `sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent import`.
The command will parse an existing `datadog.conf` and convert all the bits that
the new Agent still supports to the new format, in the new file. It also copies
configuration files for checks that are currently enabled.

Please refer to [this section][config] of the Beta documentation for a detailed
list of the configuration options that were either changed or deprecated in the
new Agent.

## CLI

### Linux

There are a few major changes:

* only the _lifecycle commands_ (i.e. `start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status` on the Agent service) should be run with `sudo service`/`sudo initctl`/`sudo systemctl`
* all the other commands need to be run with the `datadog-agent` command, located in the `PATH` (`/usr/bin`) by default
* the `info` command has been renamed `status`
* the Agent 6 does not ship a SysV-init script (previously located at `/etc/init.d/datadog-agent`)

For example, for an Agent installed on Ubuntu, the differences are as follows:

| Agent5 Command                                  |  Agent6 Command                         | Notes
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `sudo service datadog-agent start`              | `sudo service datadog-agent start`      | Start Agent as a service |
| `sudo service datadog-agent stop`               | `sudo service datadog-agent stop`       | Stop Agent running as a service |
| `sudo service datadog-agent restart`            | `sudo service datadog-agent restart`    | Restart Agent running as a service |
| `sudo service datadog-agent status`             | `sudo service datadog-agent status`     | Status of Agent service |
| `sudo service datadog-agent info`               | `sudo datadog-agent status`             | Status page of running Agent |
| `sudo service datadog-agent flare`              | `sudo datadog-agent flare`              | Send flare |
| `sudo service datadog-agent`                    | `sudo datadog-agent --help`             | Display command usage |
| `sudo -u dd-agent -- dd-agent check <check_name>` | `sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent check <check_name>` | Run a check |

**NB**: If `service` is not available on your system, use:

* on `upstart`-based systems: `sudo start/stop/restart datadog-agent`
* on `systemd`-based systems: `sudo systemctl start/stop/restart datadog-agent`

### Windows 

There are a few major changes
* the main executable name is now `agent.exe` (it was `ddagent.exe` previously)
* Commands should be run with the command line `c:\program files\datadog\datadog-agent\embedded\agent.exe <command>`
* The configuration GUI is now a browser based configuration application.  

The agent has a new set of command-line options:

| Command         | Notes
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| check           | Run the specified check |
| diagnose        | Execute some connectivity diagnosis on your system |
| flare           | Collect a flare and send it to Datadog |
| help            | Help about any command |
| hostname        | Print the hostname used by the Agent |
| import          | Import and convert configuration files from previous versions of the Agent |
| installservice  | Installs the agent within the service control manager |
| launch-gui      | starts the Datadog Agent GUI |
| regimport       | Import the registry settings into datadog.yaml |
| remove-service  | Removes the agent from the service control manager |
| restart-service | restarts the agent within the service control manager |
| start           | Start the Agent |
| start-service   | starts the agent within the service control manager |
| status          | Print the current status |
| stopservice     | stops the agent within the service control manager |
| version         | Print the version info |

#### Gui
* The browser session must be restarted each time the Agent service is restarted.  This will be fixed in an upcoming beta.

### MacOS

* the _lifecycle commands_ (former `datadog-agent start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status` on the Agent 5) are replaced by `launchctl` commands on the `com.datadoghq.agent` service, and should be run under the logged-in user. For these commands, you can also use the Datadog Agent systray app
* all the other commands can still be run with the `datadog-agent` command (located in the `PATH` (`/usr/local/bin/`) by default)
* the `info` command has been renamed `status`

A few examples:

| Agent5 Command                     |  Agent6 Command                                      | Notes                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `datadog-agent start`              | `launchctl start com.datadoghq.agent` or systray app | Start Agent as a service           |
| `datadog-agent stop`               | `launchctl stop com.datadoghq.agent` or systray app  | Stop Agent running as a service    |
| `datadog-agent restart`            | _run `stop` then `start`_ or systray app             | Restart Agent running as a service |
| `datadog-agent status`             | `launchctl list com.datadoghq.agent` or systray app  | Status of Agent service            |
| `datadog-agent info`               | `datadog-agent status` or web GUI                    | Status page of running Agent       |
| `datadog-agent flare`              | `datadog-agent flare` or web GUI                     | Send flare                         |
| _not implemented_                  | `datadog-agent --help`                               | Display command usage              |
| `datadog-agent check <check_name>` | `datadog-agent check <check_name>`                   | Run a check (unchanged)            |

## Logs

The Agent logs are still located in the `/var/log/datadog/` directory.  On Windows, the logs are still located in the `c:\programdata\Datadog\logs` directory.

Prior releases were logging to multiple files in that directory (`collector.log`,
`forwarder.log`, `dogstatsd.log`, etc). Starting with 6.0 the Agent logs to a single log file, `agent.log`.

## Checks

The base class for python checks remains `AgentCheck`, and you will import it in
the same way. However, there are a number of things that have been removed or
changed in the new implementation of the check. In addition, each check instance
is now its own instance of the class. So you cannot share state between them.

All the official integrations have had these methods removed from them, so these
will only affect custom checks.

The following methods have been removed from `AgentCheck`:

* `_roll_up_instance_metadata`
* `instance_count`
* `is_check_enabled`
* `read_config`
* `set_check_version`
* `set_manifest_path`
* `_get_statistic_name_from_method`
* `_collect_internal_stats`
* `_get_internal_profiling_stats`
* `_set_internal_profiling_stats`
* `get_library_versions`
* `get_library_info`
* `from_yaml`
* `get_service_checks`
* `has_warnings`
* `get_metrics`
* `has_events`
* `get_events`

The following things have been changed:

The function signature of the metric senders changed from:

```python
gauge(self, metric, value, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None, timestamp=None)
```

to:

```python
gauge(self, name, value, tags=None, hostname=None, device_name=None)
```

## APM agent

The APM agent (also known as _trace agent_) is shipped by default with the
Agent 6 in the Linux, MacOS and Windows packages.

Similar to the Agent 5, the APM agent is enabled by default. To disable it, set
`apm_enabled` to `false` in the main agent configuration (`datadog.yaml`).

_Optional_: If you need to use apm-specific configuration options (i.e. options that would be
specified under the `[trace.config]`, `[trace.sampler]` and `[trace.receiver]` in
the former `datadog.conf` file), specify them in `trace-agent.conf` under the agent's
configuration directory (`/etc/datadog-agent/` on Linux). This file should be
INI-formatted, similar to the former `datadog.conf` file. See the `trace-agent.conf.example`
file for an example configuration file.

We're working on merging these configuration options into the main `datadog.yaml` file.

## Process agent

The process agent is shipped by default with the Agent 6 in the Linux packages only.

The process agent is not enabled by default. To enable it, copy `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/process_agent.yaml.default`
to `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/process_agent.yaml` and edit `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/process_agent.yaml`
as following:

```yaml
init_config:
  enabled: true  # this enables the process agent

instances:
  - {}
```

_Optional_: If you need to use process-specific configuration options (i.e. options
that would be specified under the `[process.config]` section in the former `datadog.conf`
file), specify them in a `/etc/datadog-agent/process-agent.conf`. This file should
be INI-formatted, similar to the former `datadog.conf` file. See the `process-agent.conf.example`
file for an example configuration file.

We're working on merging these configuration options into the main `datadog.yaml` file.

### Docker check

The Docker check is being rewritten in Go to take advantage of the new
internal architecture of the Agent, mainly bringing a consistent behaviour
across every container related component. Therefore the Python version will
never work within Agent 6. The rewrite is not yet finished, but the new
`docker` check offers basic functionalities.

The new check is named `docker` and no longer `docker_daemon`.

For now we support a subset of metrics, docker events and `docker.status`
service check. Look into
[`docker.yaml.example`](/pkg/collector/dist/conf.d/docker.yaml.example) for
more information.

Main changes:

* Some options have moved from `docker_daemon.yaml` to the main `datadog.yaml`:
  * `docker_root` option has been split in two options `container_cgroup_root`
    and `container_proc_root`.
  * `exclude` and `include` list have been renamed `ac_include` and
    `ac_exclude`. They will impact every container-related component of the
    agent. Those only lists supports image name and container name (instead of
    any tags).
  * `exclude_pause_container` has been added to exclude pause containers on
    Kubernetes and Openshift(default to true). This will avoid users removing
    them from the exclude list by error.
  * `collect_labels_as_tags` has been renamed `docker_labels_as_tags` and now
    supports high cardinality tags

The [`import`](#configuration-files) command support a `--docker` flag to convert the old
`docker_daemon.yaml` to the new `docker.yaml`. The command will also move
needed settings from `docker_daemon.yaml` to `datadog.yaml`.

## Python Modules

While we are continuing to ship the python libraries that shipped with Agent 5,
some of the embedded libraries have been removed. `util.py` and its associated
functions have been removed from the agent. `util.headers(...)` is still included
in the agent, but implemented in C and Go and passed through to the check.

**Note:** all the official integrations have had these obsolete modules removed
from them, so these changes will only affect custom checks.

Much of the `utils` directory has been removed from the agent as well. However,
most of what was removed was not diretly related to checks and wouldn't be imported
in almost anyone's checks. The flare module, for example, was removed and
reimplemented in Go, but is unlikely to have been used by anyone in a custom check.
To learn more, you can read about the details in the [development documentation][python-dev].

## Kubernetes support

### Tagging

While Agent5 automatically collected every pod label as tags, Agent6 needs you to whilelist
labels that are relevant to you. This is done with the `kubernetes_pod_labels_as_tags` option
in `datadog.yaml`.

The following options and tags are deprecated:

     - `label_to_tag_prefix` option is superseeded by kubernetes_pod_labels_as_tags
     - `container_alias` tags are not collected anymore
     - `kube_replicate_controller` is only added if the pod is created by a replication controller,
     not systematically. Use the relevant creator tag (`kube_deployment` / `kube_daemon_set`...)

The `kube_service` tagging depends on the `Datadog Cluster Agent`, which is not released yet.

## JMX

The Agent 6 ships JMXFetch and supports all of its features, except those that
are listed in the _Known Issues_ section of the [beta docs](../beta.md).

The Agent 6 does not ship the `jmxterm` JAR. If you wish to download and use `jmxterm`, please refer to the [upstream project](https://github.com/jiaqi/jmxterm).

## GUI

Agent 6 deprecated Agent5's Windows Agent Manager GUI, replacing it with a browser-based, cross-platform one. See the [specific docs](gui.md) for more details.
