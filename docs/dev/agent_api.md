# Endpoints exposed by the Agent
The core Agent exposes a variety of HTTP and GRPC endpoints that can be organized into two
groups:
1. **Control**: These endpoints are used to send commands that can control and inspect the state of the running Agent.
2. **Telemetry**: These expose some internal telemetry that is useful for profiling and debugging.

## Control API
This API is accessible via HTTPS only and listens by default on the `localhost` interface on port `5001`. The listening interface and port can be configured using the `cmd_host` and `cmd_port` config options.

### Authentication
To avoid unprivileged users accessing the Agent control API, authentication is required and based on a generated token.
The token is written to a file (`auth_token`) that's only readable by the user that is running the Agent.

By default, the `auth_token` file is written to the same directory where the config is located. To specify a custom location, use the config option `auth_token_file_path`.

### Example
```
$ curl -qs -H "authorization: Bearer $(cat /path/to/auth_token)" -k https://localhost:5001/agent/version
{"Major":7,"Minor":41,"Patch":0,"Pre":"rc.3","Meta":"git.238.453e769","Commit":"453e7695a4"}%
```

## Telemetry API
There are 3 different systems exposing data on the same port but at
different endpoints. The default port is 5000 and can be configured by changing
`expvar_port`.

### ExpVar
Expvar is at `/debug/vars`

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:5000/debug/vars | jq '.scheduler'
{
  "ChecksEntered": 8,
  "Queues": [
    {
      "Buckets": 900,
      "Interval": 900,
      "Size": 1
    },
    {
      "Buckets": 15,
      "Interval": 15,
      "Size": 7
    }
  ],
  "QueuesCount": 2
}
```

### Prometheus-style telemetry
Prometheus style telemetry is exposed at `/telemetry` if the config option
`telemetry.enabled` is set to true.

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:5000/telemetry | head
# HELP aggregator__processed Amount of metrics/services_checks/events processed by the aggregator
# TYPE aggregator__processed counter
aggregator__processed{data_type="dogstatsd_metrics"} 1
aggregator__processed{data_type="events"} 1
aggregator__processed{data_type="metrics"} 102
aggregator__processed{data_type="service_checks"} 6
# HELP aggregator_tags_store__hits_total number of times cache already contained the tags
# TYPE aggregator_tags_store__hits_total counter
aggregator_tags_store__hits_total{cache_instance_name="aggregator"} 171
aggregator_tags_store__hits_total{cache_instance_name="timesampler #0"} 0
```

### Pprof
Pprof is available at `/debug/pprof`. This endpoint has an index that lists the
different pprof endpoints and the official go [pprof docs](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof) can also be referenced.

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=60 > ./cpu.out
```
