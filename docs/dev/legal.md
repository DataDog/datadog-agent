You must sign [our CLA](https://gist.github.com/bits-bot/55bdc97a4fdad52d97feb4d6c3d1d618)
before we can accept your contributions. The first time you
submit a PR, a bot will walk you through the automated process. On subsequent
contributions you will not be prompted unless the content of the agreement has
changed.

We sincerely appreciate your contribution and have worked hard to ensure
the CLA wording is simple, clear, and concise. It does not require you to give up
ownership of your contributions, or prevent you from using your contributions for
other purposes. We've put the agreement in place to explicitly clarify your
intellectual property license grant, for your protection as well as ours.
