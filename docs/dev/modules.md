# Creating a Go nested module

The Datadog Agent is not meant to be imported as a Go library. However, certain parts of it can be exposed as a library by making use of [nested Go modules](https://github.com/go-modules-by-example/index/blob/master/009_submodules/README.md). This exposes parts of the codebase without extracting the code to a different repository, and it avoids `replace` directive clashes.

At present the Go modules offer no public stability guarantees and are intended for internal consumption by Datadog only.

## Creating a Go nested module

Before you create a Go nested module, determine the packages that you want to expose and their dependencies. You might need to refactor the code to have an exportable package, because the `replace` directives that we use might be incompatible with your project.
After you have refactored, if needed, and listed the packages that you want to expose and their dependencies, follow these steps for each module you want to create:

1. Create `go.mod` and `go.sum` files in the module root folder. You can use `go mod init && go mod tidy` within the module folder as a starting point. Ensure the `go version` line matches the version in the main `go.mod` file.
1. On each module that depends on the current one, add a `require` directive with the module path with version `v0.0.0`.
   ```
    require (
        // ...
        github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/path/to/module v0.0.0
        // ...
    )
    ```
1. On each module that depends on the current one, add a `replace` directive to replace the module with the repository where it lives.
    ```
    // main go.mod file
    replace (
 	    github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/path/to/module => ./path/to/module
    )
    ```
1. Update the `modules.yml` file at the root of the repository. See the GoModule documentation [here](/tasks/libs/common/gomodules.py) for attributes that can be defined. The dependencies are computed automatically. Here are two example configurations:

    ```yaml
    my/module:
        condition: is_linux
        used_by_otel: true
    ```

    ```yaml
    my/module:
        independent: false
        lint_targets:
        - ./pkg
        - ./cmd
        - ./comp
        targets:
        - ./pkg
        - ./cmd
        - ./comp
    ```

1. Run `inv modules.go-work` to generate the updated `go.work` file.

## Go nested modules tooling

Go nested modules interdependencies are automatically updated when creating a release candidate or a final version, with the same tasks that update the `release.json`. For Agent version `7.X.Y` the module will have version `v0.X.Y`.

Go nested modules are tagged automatically by the `release.tag-version` invoke task, on the same commit as the main module, with a tag of the form `path/to/module/v0.X.Y`.

## The `modules.yml` file

The `modules.yml` file gathers all go modules configuration.
Each module is listed even if this module has default attributes or is ignored.

Here is an example:

```yaml
modules:
  .:
    independent: false
    lint_targets:
    - ./pkg
    - ./cmd
    - ./comp
    test_targets:
    - ./pkg
    - ./cmd
    - ./comp
  comp/api/api/def:
    used_by_otel: true
  comp/api/authtoken: default
  test/integration/serverless/src: ignored
  tools/retry_file_dump:
    should_test_condition: never
    independent: false
    should_tag: false
```

`default` is for modules with default attribute values and `ignored` for ignored modules.
To create a special configuration, the attributes of `GoModule` can be overriden. Attributes details are located within the `GoModule` class.

This file is linted with `inv modules.validate [--fix-format]`.
