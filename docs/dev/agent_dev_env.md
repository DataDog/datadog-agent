# Linux and MacOS Development Environments

## Python

The Agent embeds a full-fledged CPython interpreter so it requires the
development files to be available in the dev env. The Agent can embed Python2
and/or Python3, you will need development files for all versions you want to
support.

If you're on OSX/macOS, installing Python 2.7 and/or 3.8 with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
brings along all the development files needed:

**Please note that not using Python versions explicitly supported, you may have
problems running the built Agent's Python checks, especially if using a virtualenv.
At this time, only Python 3.8 is confirmed to work as expected in the development
environment.**
```
brew install python@2
brew install python@3.8
```

On Linux, depending on the distribution, you might need to explicitly install
the development files, for example on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev
sudo apt-get install python3.8-dev
```

On Windows, install Python 2.7 and/or 3.8 via the [official installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Additional Windows Tools
You will also need the Visual Studio for [Visual Studio for Python installer](http://aka.ms/vcpython27)

Download the [gcc toolchain](http://win-builds.org/).
- From the graphical package manager, select and install the needed libraries, leave the default (select all) if you're unsure.
- Make sure to select `x86_64`.
- Add installation folder to the `%PATH%`.


### Python Dependencies

#### Preface

To protect and isolate your system-wide python installation, a python virtual
environment is _highly_ recommended (though optional). It will help keep a
self-contained development environment and ensure a clean system Python.

**Please note that due to the [way
some virtual environments handle executable paths](https://bugs.python.org/issue22213)
(e.g. `python -m venv`), not all virtual environment options will be able to run the built
agent correctly. At this time, the only confirmed virtual enviroment that is known for
sure to work is `virtualenv`.**

- Install the virtualenv module:
`python3 -m pip install virtualenv`
- Create the virtual environment:
`virtualenv $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/venv`
- [Activate the virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#activators) (OS-dependent).
  This must be done for every new terminal before you start.

If using virtual environments when running the built Agent, you may need to override the built
Agent's search path for Python check packages using the `PYTHONPATH` variable (your target path
must have the [pre-requisite core integration packages installed](https://datadoghq.dev/integrations-core/setup/)
though).
```sh
PYTHONPATH="./venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH" ./agent run ...
```

### Invoke

[Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) is a task runner written in Python
that is extensively used in this project to orchestrate builds and test
runs. Our invoke tasks are only compatible with Python 3, thus you will
need to use Python 3 to run them.

Though you may install invoke in a variety of way we suggest you use
the provided [requirements](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/requirements.txt)
file and `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This procedure ensures you not only get the correct version of `invoke`, but
also any additional python dependencies our development workflow may require,
at their expected versions.
It will also pull other handy development tools/deps (`reno`, or `docker`).

Tasks are usually parameterized and Invoke comes with some default values that
are used in the official build. Such values are listed in the `invoke.yaml`
file at the root of this repo and can be overridden by setting `INVOKE_*` env
variables (see Invoke docs for more details).

## Golang

You must [install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) version `1.14`. Make
sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH` otherwise `invoke` cannot use any
additional tool it might need.

**Please note that versions of Golang that aren't an exact match to the version
specified in our build images (see e.g. [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/.circleci/images/builder/Dockerfile#L1))
may not be able to build the agent and/or the [rtloader](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/master/rtloader)
binary properly.**

## Installing dependencies

From the root of `datadog-agent`, run `invoke deps`. This uses `go` to install the necessary dependencies.

## System or Embedded?

When working on the Agent codebase you can choose among two different ways to
build the binary, informally named _System_ and _Embedded_ builds. For most
contribution scenarios you should rely on the System build (the default) and use
the Embedded one only for specific use cases. Let's explore the differences.

### System build

_System_ builds use your operating system's standard system libraries to satisfy
the Agent's external dependencies. Since, for example, macOS 10.11 may provide a
different version of Python than macOS 10.12, system builds on each of these
platforms may produce different Agent binaries. If this doesn't matter to
you—perhaps you just want to contribute a quick bugfix—do a System build; it's
easier and faster than an Embedded build. System build is the default for all
build and test tasks, so you don't need to configure anything there. But to make
sure you have system copies of all the Agent's dependencies, skip the
_Embedded build_ section below and read on to see how to install them via your
usual package manager (apt, yum, brew, etc).

### Embedded build

_Embedded_ builds download specifically-versioned dependencies and compile them
locally from sources. We run Embedded builds to create Datadog's official Agent
releases (i.e. RPMs, debs, etc), and while you can run the same builds while
developing locally, the process is as slow as it sounds. Hence, you should only
use them when you care about reproducible builds. For example:

  * you want to build an agent binary that can be used as-is to replace the binary
    of an existing agent installation
  * some dependencies are not available on your system
  * you're working or debugging at a very low level: let's say you're adding a
    function to the Python bindings, you want to make sure you're using the exact
    same versions of Python as the official Agent packages

Embedded builds rely on [Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) to download
and build dependencies, so you need a recent `ruby` environment with `bundler`
installed. See [how to build Agent packages with Omnibus][agent-omnibus] for more
details.

If you want to perform an Embedded build, you need to set the `use_system_libs`
boolean flag value to _false_, either exporting the env var `INVOKE_USE_SYSTEM_LIBS=false`,
changing the `invoke.yaml` file or passing the corresponding arg to the build and
test tasks, like `invoke build --use-system-libs=false`.

### Systemd

The agent is able to collect systemd journal logs using a wrapper on the systemd utility library.

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt-get install libsystemd-dev
```

On Redhat/CentOS:
```
sudo yum install systemd-devel
```

## Docker

If you want to build a Docker image containing the Agent, or if you wan to run
[system and integration tests][testing] you need to run a recent version of Docker in your
dev environment.

## Doxygen

We use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) to generate the documentation for the `rtloader` part of the Agent.

To generate it (using the `invoke rtloader.generate-doc` command), you'll need to have Doxygen installed on your system and available in your `$PATH`. You can compile and install Doxygen from source with the instructions available [here](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html).
Alternatively, you can use already-compiled Doxygen binaries from [here](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html).

To get the dependency graphs, you may also need to install the `dot` executable from [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) and add it to your `$PATH`.

## Pre-commit hooks

It is optional but recommended to install `pre-commit` to run a number of checks done by the CI locally.
To install it, run:

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The `shellcheck` pre-commit hook requires having the `shellcheck` binary installed and in your `$PATH`.
To install it, run:

```sh
inv install-shellcheck --destination <path>
```

(by default, the shellcheck binary is installed in `/usr/local/bin`).

# Setting up your Windows development environment

## Code editor

[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended as it's lightweight and versatile.

Building on Windows would require multiple 3rd-party softwares to be installed. To avoid the complexity, it is recommended to make the code change in VS Code then do the build in Docker image.
