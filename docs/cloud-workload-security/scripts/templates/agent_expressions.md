## Agent expression syntax
Rules for Cloud Workload Security (CWS) are first evaluated in the Datadog Agent to decide what system activity to collect. This portion of a CWS rule is called the Agent expression. Agent expressions use Datadog's Security Language (SECL). The standard format of a SECL expression is as follows:

{% raw %}
{{< code-block lang="javascript" >}}
{% endraw %}
<event-type>.<event-attribute> <operator> <value> <event-attribute> ...
{% raw %}
{{< /code-block >}}
{% endraw %}

Using this format, an example rule looks like this:
{% raw %}
{{< code-block lang="javascript" >}}
{% endraw %}
open.file.path == "/etc/shadow" && file.path not in ["/usr/sbin/vipw"]
{% raw %}
{{< /code-block >}}
{% endraw %}

## Triggers
Triggers are events that correspond to types of activity seen by the system. The currently supported set of triggers is:

| SECL Event | Type | Definition | Agent Version |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------- |
{% for event_type in event_types %}
{% if event_type.name != "*" %}
| `{{ event_type.name }}` | {{ event_type.kind }} | {{ event_type.definition }} | {{ event_type.min_agent_version }} |
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Operators
SECL operators are used to combine event attributes together into a full expression. The following operators are available:

| SECL Operator         | Types            |  Definition                           | Agent Version |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|
| `==`                  | Process          | Equal                                    | 7.27          |
| `!=`                  | File             | Not equal                                | 7.27          |
| `>`                   | File             | Greater                                  | 7.27          |
| `>=`                  | File             | Greater or equal                         | 7.27          |
| `<`                   | File             | Lesser                                   | 7.27          |
| `<=`                  | File             | Lesser or equal                          | 7.27          |
| `!`                   | File             | Not                                      | 7.27          |
| `^`                   | File             | Binary not                               | 7.27          |
| `in [elem1, ...]`     | File             | Element is contained in list             | 7.27          |
| `not in [elem1, ...]` | File             | Element is not contained in list         | 7.27          |
| `[~pattern, ...]`     | File             | Regex pattern is (not) contained in list | 7.27          |
| `=~`                  | File             | String matching                          | 7.27          |
| `&`                   | File             | Binary and                               | 7.27          |
| `|`                   | File             | Binary or                                | 7.27          |
| `&&`                  | File             | Logical and                              | 7.27          |
| `||`                  | File             | Logical or                               | 7.27          |

## Helpers
Helpers exist in SECL that enable users to write advanced rules without needing to rely on generic techniques such as regex.

### Command line arguments
The *args_flags* and *args_options* are helpers to ease the writing of CWS rules based on command line arguments.

*args_flags* is used to catch arguments that start with either one or two hyphen characters but do not accept any associated value.

Examples:
* `version` is part of *args_flags* for the command `cat --version`
* `l` and `n` both are in *args_flags* for the command `netstat -ln`


*args_options* is used to catch arguments that start with either one or two hyphen characters and accepts a value either specified as the same argument but separated by the ‘=’ character or specified as the next argument.

Examples:
* `T=8` and `width=8` both are in *args_options* for the command `ls -T 8 --width=8`
* `exec.args_options ~= [ “s=.*\’” ]` can be used to detect `sudoedit` was launched with `-s` argument and a command that ends with a `\`

### File rights

The *file.rights* attribute can now be used in addition to *file.mode*. *file.mode* can hold values set by the kernel, while the *file.rights* only holds the values set by the user. These rights may be more familiar because they are in the `chmod` commands.

## Event types

{% for event_type in event_types %}
{% if event_type.name == "*" %}
{% set prefix = "*." %}
### Common to all event types
{% else %}
{% set prefix = "" %}
### Event `{{ event_type.name }}`

{{ event_type.definition }}
{% endif %}

| Property | Type | Definition |
| -------- | ---- | ---------- |
{% for property in event_type.properties %}
| `{{ prefix }}{{ property.name }}` | {{ property.datatype }} | {{ property.definition }} |
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

{% raw %}
{{< partial name="whats-next/whats-next.html" >}}
{% endraw %}
