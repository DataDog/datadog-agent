## Linux Agent attributes and helpers
This documentation describes Linux attributes and helpers of the [Datadog's Security Language (SECL)][1].

Rules using Linux attributes and helpers must include an OS rule filter field as follows.


{{< code-block lang="yaml" >}}
id: [...]
expression: [...]
filters:
  - os == "linux"

{{< /code-block >}}

## Triggers
Triggers are events that correspond to types of activity seen by the system. The currently supported set of triggers is:

| SECL Event | Type | Definition | Agent Version |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------- |
| `bind` | Network | A bind was executed | 7.37 |
| `bpf` | Kernel | A BPF command was executed | 7.33 |
| `capset` | Process | A process changed its capacity set | 7.27 |
| `chdir` | File | [Experimental] A process changed the current directory | 7.52 |
| `chmod` | File | A file’s permissions were changed | 7.27 |
| `chown` | File | A file’s owner was changed | 7.27 |
| `connect` | Network | A connect was executed | 7.60 |
| `dns` | Network | A DNS request was sent | 7.36 |
| `exec` | Process | A process was executed or forked | 7.27 |
| `exit` | Process | A process was terminated | 7.38 |
| `imds` | Network | An IMDS event was captured | 7.55 |
| `link` | File | Create a new name/alias for a file | 7.27 |
| `load_module` | Kernel | A new kernel module was loaded | 7.35 |
| `mkdir` | File | A directory was created | 7.27 |
| `mmap` | Kernel | A mmap command was executed | 7.35 |
| `mount` | File | [Experimental] A filesystem was mounted | 7.42 |
| `mprotect` | Kernel | A mprotect command was executed | 7.35 |
| `open` | File | A file was opened | 7.27 |

| `unload_module` | Kernel | A kernel module was deleted | 7.35 |
| `utimes` | File | Change file access/modification times | 7.27 |

## Variables
SECL variables are predefined variables that can be used as values or as part of values.

For example, rule using a `process.pid` variable looks like this:


{{< code-block lang="javascript" >}}
open.file.path == "/proc/${process.pid}/maps"

{{< /code-block >}}

List of the available variables:

| SECL Variable         |  Definition                           | Agent Version |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|
| `process.pid`         | Process PID                           | 7.33          |

## CIDR and IP range
CIDR and IP matching is possible in SECL. One can use operators such as `in`, `not in`, or `allin` combined with CIDR or IP notations.

Such rules can be written as follows:


{{< code-block lang="javascript" >}}
dns.question.name == "example.com" && network.destination.ip in [192.168.1.25, 10.0.0.0/24]

{{< /code-block >}}

## Helpers
Helpers exist in SECL that enable users to write advanced rules without needing to rely on generic techniques such as regex.

### Command line arguments
The *args_flags* and *args_options* are helpers to ease the writing of CSM Threats rules based on command line arguments.

*args_flags* is used to catch arguments that start with either one or two hyphen characters but do not accept any associated value.

Examples:
* `version` is part of *args_flags* for the command `cat --version`
* `l` and `n` both are in *args_flags* for the command `netstat -ln`


*args_options* is used to catch arguments that start with either one or two hyphen characters and accepts a value either specified as the same argument but separated by the ‘=’ character or specified as the next argument.

Examples:
* `T=8` and `width=8` both are in *args_options* for the command `ls -T 8 --width=8`
* `exec.args_options in [ r"s=.*\\" ]` can be used to detect `sudoedit` was launched with `-s` argument and a command that ends with a `\`

### File rights

The *file.rights* attribute can now be used in addition to *file.mode*. *file.mode* can hold values set by the kernel, while the *file.rights* only holds the values set by the user. These rights may be more familiar because they are in the `chmod` commands.
