## Agent expression syntax
Cloud Workload Security (CWS) first evaluates activity within the Datadog Agent against Agent expressions to decide what activity to collect. This portion of a CWS rule is called the Agent expression. Agent expressions use Datadog's Security Language (SECL). The standard format of a SECL expression is as follows:


{{< code-block lang="javascript" >}}
<event-type>.<event-attribute> <operator> <value> <event-attribute> ...

{{< /code-block >}}

Using this format, an example rule looks like this:

{{< code-block lang="javascript" >}}
open.file.path == "/etc/shadow" && file.path not in ["/usr/sbin/vipw"]

{{< /code-block >}}

## Triggers
Triggers are events that correspond to types of activity seen by the system. The currently supported set of triggers is:

## Operators
SECL operators are used to combine event attributes together into a full expression. The following operators are available:

| SECL Operator         | Types            |  Definition                              | Agent Version |

| `^`                   | File             | Binary not                               | 7.27          |
| `in [elem1, ...]`     | File             | Element is contained in list             | 7.27          |
| `not in [elem1, ...]` | File             | Element is not contained in list         | 7.27          |
| `=~`                  | File             | String matching                          | 7.27          |

| `\|`                  | File             | Binary or                                | 7.27          |
| `&&`                  | File             | Logical and                              | 7.27          |
| `\|\|`                | File             | Logical or                               | 7.27          |

## Patterns and regular expressions
Patterns or regular expressions can be used in SECL expressions. They can be used with the `in`, `not in`, `=~`, and `!~` operators.

| Format           |  Example             | Supported Fields   | Agent Version |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| `~"pattern"`     | `~"httpd.*"`         | All                | 7.27          |
| `r"regexp"`      | `r"rc[0-9]+"`        | All except `.path` | 7.27          |

Patterns on `.path` fields will be used as Glob. `*` will match files and folders at the same level. `**`, introduced in 7.34, can be used at the end of a path in order to match all the files and subfolders.

## Duration
You can use SECL to write rules based on durations, which trigger on events that occur during a specific time period. For example, trigger on an event where a secret file is accessed more than a certain length of time after a process is created.
Such a rule could be written as follows:


{{< code-block lang="javascript" >}}
open.file.path == "/etc/secret" && process.file.name == "java" && process.created_at > 5s

{{< /code-block >}}

Durations are numbers with a unit suffix. The supported suffixes are "s", "m", "h".

## Variables
SECL variables are predefined variables that can be used as values or as part of values.

For example, rule using a `process.pid` variable looks like this:


{{< code-block lang="javascript" >}}
open.file.path == "/proc/${process.pid}/maps"

{{< /code-block >}}

List of the available variables:

| SECL Variable         |  Definition                           | Agent Version |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|
| `process.pid`         | Process PID                           | 7.33          |

## Helpers
Helpers exist in SECL that enable users to write advanced rules without needing to rely on generic techniques such as regex.

### Command line arguments
The *args_flags* and *args_options* are helpers to ease the writing of CWS rules based on command line arguments.

*args_flags* is used to catch arguments that start with either one or two hyphen characters but do not accept any associated value.

Examples:
* `version` is part of *args_flags* for the command `cat --version`
* `l` and `n` both are in *args_flags* for the command `netstat -ln`


*args_options* is used to catch arguments that start with either one or two hyphen characters and accepts a value either specified as the same argument but separated by the ‘=’ character or specified as the next argument.

Examples:
* `T=8` and `width=8` both are in *args_options* for the command `ls -T 8 --width=8`
* `exec.args_options ~= [ “s=.*\’” ]` can be used to detect `sudoedit` was launched with `-s` argument and a command that ends with a `\`

### File rights

The *file.rights* attribute can now be used in addition to *file.mode*. *file.mode* can hold values set by the kernel, while the *file.rights* only holds the values set by the user. These rights may be more familiar because they are in the `chmod` commands.
