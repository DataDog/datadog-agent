# Registrations

Components generally need to talk to one another!
In simple cases, that occurs by method calls.
But in many cases, a single component needs to communicate with a number of other components that all share some characteristics.
For example, the `comp/core/health` component monitors the health of many other components, and `comp/workloadmeta/scheduler` provides workload events to an arbitrary number of subscribers.

The convention in the Agent codebase is to use [value groups](./fx.md#value-groups) to accomplish this.
The _collecting_ component requires a slice of some _collected type_, and the _providing_ components provide values of that type.
Consider an example case of an HTTP server component to which endpoints can be attached.
The server is the collecting component, requiring a slice of type `[]*endpoint`, where `*endpoint` is the collected type.
Providing components provide values of type `*endpoint`.

The convention is to "wrap" the collected type in a `Registration` struct type which embeds `fx.Out` and has tag `group:"pkgname"`, where `pkgname` is the short package name (Fx requires a group name, and this is as good as any).
This helps providing components avoid the common mistake of omitting the tag.
Because it is wrapped in an exported `Registration` type, the collected type can be an unexported type, as in the example below.

The collecting component should define the registration type and a constructor for it.

```go
// --- comp/server/component.go --- (the collecting component)

// ...
// Server endpoints are provided by other components, by providing a server.Registration
// instance.
//  ...
package server

type endpoint struct {  // (the collected type)
    ...
}

type Registration struct {
    fx.Out

    Endpoint endpoint `group:"server"`
}

// NewRegistration creates a new Registration instance for the given endpoint.
func NewRegistration(route string, handler func()) Registration { .. }
```

Its implementation then requires a slice of the collected type (`endpoint`), again using `group:"server"`:

```go
// --- comp/server/server.go ---

// endpoint defines an endpoint on this server.
type endpoint struct { .. }

type dependencies struct {
    fx.In

    Registrations []endpoint `group:"server"`
}

func newServer(deps dependencies) Component {
    // ..
    for _, e := range deps.Registrations {
        if e.handler == nil {
            continue
        }
        // ..
    }
    // ..
}
```

It's good practice to ignore zero values, as that allows providing components to skip
the registration if desired.

Finally, the providing component (in this case, `foo`) includes a registration in its output as an additional provided type, beyond its `Component` type:

```go
// --- comp/foo/foo.go ---  (the providing component)
func newFoo(deps dependencies) (Component, server.Registration) {
    // ..
    return foo, server.NewRegistration("/things/foo", foo.handler)
}
```

This technique has some caveats to be aware of:

 * The providing components are instantiated before the collecting component.
 * Fx treats value groups as the collecting component depending on all of the providing components.
   This means that the providing components cannot depend on the collecting component, as this would represent a dependency cycle.
 * Fx will instantiate _all_ declared providing components before the collecting component, regardless of whether their `Component` type is required.
   This may lead to components being instantiated in unexpected circumstances.
