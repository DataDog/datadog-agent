# Guidelines

This section describes the mechanics of implementing apps, components, and bundles.

The guidelines are quite prescriptive, with the intent of making all components "look the same".
This reduces cognitive load when using components -- no need to remember one component's peculiarities.
It also allows Agent-wide changes, where we make the same formulaic change to each component.
If a situation arises that contradicts the guidelines, then we can update the guidelines (and change all affected components).
