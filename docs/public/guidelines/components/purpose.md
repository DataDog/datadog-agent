# Purpose of component guidelines

This section describes the mechanics of implementing [apps](defining-apps.md), [components](defining-components.md), and [bundles](defining-bundles.md).

The guidelines are quite prescriptive, with the intent of making all components "look the same". This reduces cognitive load when using components -- no need to remember one component's peculiarities. It also allows Agent-wide changes, where we make the same formulaic change to each component. If a situation arises that contradicts the guidelines, then we can update the guidelines (and change all affected components).
