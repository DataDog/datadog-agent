# Set up development environment

## Tooling

### Installers

=== "macOS"
    === "GUI installer"
        1. In your browser, download the `.pkg` file: [dda-universal.pkg](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent-dev/releases/latest/download/dda-universal.pkg)
        2. Run your downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions.
        3. Restart your terminal.
        4. To verify that the shell can find and run the `deva` command in your `PATH`, use the following command.

            ```
            $ dda --version
            <DDA_LATEST_VERSION>
            ```
    === "Command line installer"
        1. Download the file using the `curl` command. The `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to. In this example, the file is written to `dda-universal.pkg` in the current directory.

            ```
            curl -Lo dda-universal.pkg https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent-dev/releases/latest/download/dda-universal.pkg
            ```
        2. Run the standard macOS [`installer`](https://ss64.com/osx/installer.html) program, specifying the downloaded `.pkg` file as the source. Use the `-pkg` parameter to specify the name of the package to install, and the `-target /` parameter for the drive in which to install the package. The files are installed to `/usr/local/deva`, and an entry is created at `/etc/paths.d/deva` that instructs shells to add the `/usr/local/deva` directory to. You must include sudo on the command to grant write permissions to those folders.

            ```
            sudo installer -pkg ./dda-universal.pkg -target /
            ```
        3. Restart your terminal.
        4. To verify that the shell can find and run the `deva` command in your `PATH`, use the following command.

            ```
            $ dda --version
            <DDA_LATEST_VERSION>
            ```

=== "Windows"
    === "GUI installer"
        1. In your browser, download one the `.msi` files:
              - [dda-x64.msi](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent-dev/releases/latest/download/dda-x64.msi)
        2. Run your downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions.
        3. Restart your terminal.
        4. To verify that the shell can find and run the `deva` command in your `PATH`, use the following command.

            ```
            $ dda --version
            <DDA_LATEST_VERSION>
            ```
    === "Command line installer"
        1. Download and run the installer using the standard Windows [`msiexec`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec) program, specifying one of the `.msi` files as the source. Use the `/passive` and `/i` parameters to request an unattended, normal installation.

            === "x64"
                ```
                msiexec /passive /i https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent-dev/releases/latest/download/dda-x64.msi
                ```
            === "x86"
                ```
                msiexec /passive /i https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent-dev/releases/latest/download/dda-x86.msi
                ```
        2. Restart your terminal.
        3. To verify that the shell can find and run the `deva` command in your `PATH`, use the following command.

            ```
            $ dda --version
            <DDA_LATEST_VERSION>
            ```

### Standalone binaries

After downloading the archive corresponding to your platform and architecture, extract the binary to a directory that is on your PATH and rename to `deva`.

### pip

dda is available on PyPI and can be installed with [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip).

```
pip install dda
```

!!! warning
    - This method modifies the Python environment in which you choose to install.
    - Python 3.12.x is required.

## Windows

To build the agent on Windows, see [datadog-agent-buildimages](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent-buildimages/tree/main/windows).

## Linux and macOS

### Python

The Agent embeds a full-fledged CPython interpreter so it requires the development files to be available in the dev env. The Agent can embed Python 3, you will need development files for the version you want to support.

If you're on OSX/macOS, installing 3.12 with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
brew install python@3.12
```

On Linux, depending on the distribution, you might need to explicitly install the development files, for example on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install python3.12-dev
```

On Windows, install 3.12 via the [official installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) brings along all the development files needed:

!!! warning
    If you don't use one of the Python versions that are explicitly supported, you may have problems running the built Agent's Python checks, especially if using a virtualenv. At this time, only Python 3.12 is confirmed to work as expected in the development environment.

#### Python Dependencies

To protect and isolate your system-wide python installation, a python virtual environment is _highly_ recommended (though optional). It will help keep a self-contained development environment and ensure a clean system Python.

!!! note
    Due to the [way some virtual environments handle executable paths](https://bugs.python.org/issue22213) (e.g. `python -m venv`), not all virtual environment options will be able to run the built Agent correctly. At this time, the only confirmed virtual environment creator that is known for sure to work is `virtualenv`.

- Install the virtualenv module:
    ```
    python3 -m pip install virtualenv
    ```
- Create the virtual environment:
    ```
    virtualenv $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/venv
    ```
- [Activate the virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#activators) (OS-dependent). This must be done for every new terminal before you start.

If using virtual environments when running the built Agent, you may need to override the built Agent's search path for Python check packages using the `PYTHONPATH` variable (your target path must have the [pre-requisite core integration packages installed](https://datadoghq.dev/integrations-core/setup/) though).

```sh
PYTHONPATH="./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH" ./agent run ...
```

See also some notes in [./checks](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/main/docs/dev/checks) about running custom python checks.

### Golang

You must [install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) version `<<<GO_VERSION>>>` or later. Make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`, otherwise [tooling](#tooling) cannot use any additional tool it might need.

!!! note
    Versions of Golang that aren't an exact match to the version specified in our build images (see e.g. [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent-buildimages/blob/c025473ee467ee6d884d532e4c12c7d982ce8fe1/circleci/Dockerfile#L43)) may not be able to build the agent and/or the [rtloader](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/main/rtloader) binary properly.

#### Installing tools

From the root of `datadog-agent`, run `inv install-tools` to install go tooling. This uses `go` to install the necessary dependencies.

### System or Embedded?

When working on the Agent codebase you can choose among two different ways to build the binary, informally named _System_ and _Embedded_ builds. For most contribution scenarios you should rely on the System build (the default) and use the Embedded one only for specific use cases. Let's explore the differences.

#### System build

_System_ builds use your operating system's standard system libraries to satisfy the Agent's external dependencies. Since, for example, macOS 10.11 may provide a different version of Python than macOS 10.12, system builds on each of these platforms may produce different Agent binaries. If this doesn't matter to you—perhaps you just want to contribute a quick bugfix—do a System build; it's easier and faster than an Embedded build. System build is the default for all build and test tasks, so you don't need to configure anything there. But to make sure you have system copies of all the Agent's dependencies, skip the _Embedded build_ section below and read on to see how to install them via your usual package manager (apt, yum, brew, etc).

#### Embedded build

_Embedded_ builds download specifically-versioned dependencies and compile them locally from sources. We run Embedded builds to create Datadog's official Agent releases (i.e. RPMs, debs, etc), and while you can run the same builds while developing locally, the process is as slow as it sounds. Hence, you should only use them when you care about reproducible builds. For example:

  * you want to build an agent binary that can be used as-is to replace the binary of an existing agent installation
  * some dependencies are not available on your system
  * you're working or debugging at a very low level: let's say you're adding a function to the Python bindings, you want to make sure you're using the exact same versions of Python as the official Agent packages

Embedded builds rely on [Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) to download and build dependencies, so you need a recent `ruby` environment with `bundler` installed. See [how to build Agent packages with Omnibus](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/docs/dev/agent_omnibus.md) for more details.

#### Systemd

The agent is able to collect systemd journal logs using a wrapper on the systemd utility library.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install libsystemd-dev
```

On Redhat/CentOS:

```
sudo yum install systemd-devel
```

### Docker

If you want to build a Docker image containing the Agent, or if you wan to run [system and integration tests](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/docs/dev/agent_tests.md) you need to run a recent version of Docker in your dev environment.

### Doxygen

We use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl) to generate the documentation for the `rtloader` part of the Agent.

To generate it (using the `inv rtloader.generate-doc` command), you'll need to have Doxygen installed on your system and available in your `$PATH`. You can compile and install Doxygen from source with the instructions available [here](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html). Alternatively, you can use already-compiled Doxygen binaries from [here](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html).

To get the dependency graphs, you may also need to install the `dot` executable from [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) and add it to your `$PATH`.

### Pre-commit hooks

It is optional but recommended to install `pre-commit` to run a number of checks done by the CI locally.

#### Installation

To install it, run:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false pre-commit install  # buildvcs avoids errors when getting go dependencies
```

The `shellcheck` pre-commit hook requires having the `shellcheck` binary installed and in your `$PATH`. To install it, run:

```sh
dda inv install-shellcheck --destination <path>
```

(by default, the shellcheck binary is installed in `/usr/local/bin`).

#### Skipping `pre-commit`

If you want to skip `pre-commit` for a specific commit you can add `--no-verify` to the `git commit` command.

#### Running `pre-commit` manually

If you want to run one of the checks manually, you can run `pre-commit run <check name>`.

You can run it on all files with the `--all-files` flag.

```sh
pre-commit run flake8 --all-files  # run flake8 on all files
```

See `pre-commit run --help` for further options.

### Setting up Visual Studio Code Dev Container

[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [devcontainer plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) allow to use a container as remote development environment in vscode. It simplify and isolate the dependencies needed to develop in this repository.

To configure the vscode editor to use a container as remote development environment you need to:

- Install the [devcontainer plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and the [golang language plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go).
- Run the following command `inv vscode.setup-devcontainer --image "<image name>"`. This command will create the devcontainer configuration file `./devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
- Start or restart your vscode editor.
- A pop-up should show-up to propose to "reopen in container" your workspace.
- The first start, it might propose you to install the golang plugin dependencies/tooling.

## Windows development environment

### Code editor

[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended as it's lightweight and versatile.

Building on Windows requires multiple 3rd-party software to be installed. To avoid the complexity, Datadog recommends to make the code change in VS Code, and then do the build in Docker image. For complete information, see [Build the Agent packages](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/docs/dev/agent_omnibus.md)
