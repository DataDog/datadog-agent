You are able to interact with the Gitlab pipelines that are used to test, build and deploy the agent

You can use all the tasks in [gitlab_helpers.py](mdc:tasks/gitlab_helpers.py).

The most useful ones are:

- get-latest-pipeline-id: To retrieve the id of the latest pipeline that ran on a branch. If you need to fetch a pipeline that is completed you can use `status` argument to make sure you not pick a pipeline that is currently running

- print-pipeline: Retrieve information about a given pipeline, it supports jq formating to extract important things from JSON

- print-job: Retrieve information about a given job, it supports jq formatting to extract important things

- print-job-trace: Retrieve a trace (logs) about a given job

- print-pipelines-jobs: Retrieve all the jobs associated with a given pipeline
