## 2.0.3 (2019-05-28)

**Features**

- Filter reported processes _[(STAC-3401)](https://stackstate.atlassian.net/browse/STAC-3401)_

  This feature changed and extended the agent configuration.
  
  Under the `process_config` section we removed `blacklist_patterns` and introduced the following:
  
  ```
  process_blacklist:
    # A list of regex patterns that will exclude a process arguments if matched.
    patterns:
      - ...
    # Inclusions rules for blacklisted processes which reports high usage.
    inclusions:
      amount_top_cpu_pct_usage: 3
      cpu_pct_usage_threshold: 20
      amount_top_io_read_usage: 3
      amount_top_io_write_usage: 3
      amount_top_mem_usage: 3
      mem_usage_threshold: 35
  ```
  
  Those configurations can be provided through environment variables as well:
    
  | Parameter | Default | Description |
  |-----------|---------|-------------|
  | `STS_PROCESS_BLACKLIST_PATTERNS` | [see github](https://github.com/StackVista/stackstate-process-agent/blob/master/config/config_nix.go) | A list of regex patterns that will exclude a process if matched |
  | `STS_PROCESS_BLACKLIST_INCLUSIONS_TOP_CPU` | 0 | Number of processes to report that have a high CPU usage |
  | `STS_PROCESS_BLACKLIST_INCLUSIONS_TOP_IO_READ` | 0 | Number of processes to report that have a high IO read usage |
  | `STS_PROCESS_BLACKLIST_INCLUSIONS_TOP_IO_WRITE` | 0 | Number of processes to report that have a high IO write usage |
  | `STS_PROCESS_BLACKLIST_INCLUSIONS_TOP_MEM` | 0 | Number of processes to report that have a high Memory usage |
  | `STS_PROCESS_BLACKLIST_INCLUSIONS_CPU_THRESHOLD` |  | Threshold that enables the reporting of high CPU usage processes |
  | `STS_PROCESS_BLACKLIST_INCLUSIONS_MEM_THRESHOLD` |  | Threshold that enables the reporting of high Memory usage processes |

- Report localhost connections within the same network namespace _[(STAC-2891)](https://stackstate.atlassian.net/browse/STAC-2891)_
