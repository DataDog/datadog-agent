          # Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
          # CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
          # it does not depend on any information only available in another
          # section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
          # must be readable independently of the other.
          #
          # Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

          upgrade:
            - |
              List upgrade notes here, or remove this section.
              Upgrade notes should be rare: only list known/potential breaking changes,
              or major behaviorial changes that require user action before the upgrade.
              Notes here must include steps that users can follow to 1. know if they're
              affected and 2. handle the change gracefully on their end.
          features:
            - |
              List new features here, or remove this section.
          enhancements:
            - |
              List enhancements (new behavior that is too small to be
              considered a new feature), or remove this section.
          issues:
            - |
              List known issues here, or remove this section.
          deprecations:
            - |
              List deprecations notes here, or remove this section.

          other:
            - |
              Add here every other information you want in the CHANGELOG that
              don't fit in any other section. This section should rarely be
