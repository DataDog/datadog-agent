          # Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
          # CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
          # it does not depend on any information only available in another
          # section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
          # must be readable independently of the other.
          #
          # Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.
