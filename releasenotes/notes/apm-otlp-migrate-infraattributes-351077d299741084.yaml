# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

upgrade:
  - |
    If you are using a DDOT trace pipeline which includes a `datadog` exporter
    but no `infraattributes` processor, container tags will no longer be added
    to the traces. Please add an `infraattributes` processor to your pipeline to
    enable this functionality.
enhancements:
  - |
    The non-DDOT OTLP ingestion pipeline now includes the infraattributes processor
    for logs and metrics pipelines, enabling container tag enrichment.
