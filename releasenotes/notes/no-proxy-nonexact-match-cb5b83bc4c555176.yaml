# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added no_proxy_nonexact_match as a configuration setting which 
    allows non-exact URL and IP address matching. The new behavior uses 
    the go http proxy function documented here 
    https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/http/httpproxy#Config 
    If the new behavior is disabled, a warning will be logged if a url or IP 
    proxy behavior will change in the future.
