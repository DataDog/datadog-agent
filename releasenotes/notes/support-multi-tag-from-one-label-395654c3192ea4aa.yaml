# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add logic to support multiple tags created by a single label/annotaion. 
    For example, add the following config to extract tags for chart_name and app_chart_name. 
      podLabelsAsTags: 
        chart_name: chart_name, app_chart_name 
    Note: the format must be a comma-separated list of tags.
