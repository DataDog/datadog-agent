# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Implement check filtering in the scheduler and CLI to enforce infrastructure basic mode restrictions. When running in basic mode (``infrastructure_mode: "basic"``), only core system checks (cpu, disk, memory, network, uptime, load, io, file_handle, ntp, system_core, telemetry) are allowed to execute. Additional checks can be allowlisted via the ``allowed_additional_checks`` configuration option.
