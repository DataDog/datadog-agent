# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes the `/ready` health endpoint on the cluster-agent.

    The `/ready` health endpoint was reporting 200 at the cluster-agent startup and was then, permanently reporting 500 even though the cluster-agent was experiencing no problem.
    In the body of the response, we could see that a `healthcheck` component was failing.
    This change fixes this issue.
