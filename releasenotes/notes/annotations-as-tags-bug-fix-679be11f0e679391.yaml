# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Addressed a bug in the cluster-agent API that prevented tag extraction for annotations from working due to client
    side filtering. The fix was implemented in both the node-agent and the cluster-agent. Now, node-agent clients
    specify the annotations filter when querying the cluster-agent.
