    Fixes scheduling of non-working container checks introduced by environment autodiscovery in 7.26. Features can now be exluded from autodiscovery results through `autoconfig_exclude_features`.
    Example: autoconfig_exclude_features: ["docker","cri"] or DD_AUTOCONFIG_EXCLUDE_FEATURES="docker cri"
    Fix typo in variable used to disable environment autodiscovery and make it usable in `datadog.yaml`. You should now set `autoconfig_from_environment: false` or `DD_AUTOCONFIG_FROM_ENVIRONMENT=false`
