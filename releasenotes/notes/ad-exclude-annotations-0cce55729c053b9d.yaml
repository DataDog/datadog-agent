# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add ability to filter kubernetes containers based on autodiscovery annotation. Containers in a pod
    can now be omitted by setting `ad.datadoghq.com/<container_name>.exclude` as an annotation on the
    pod. Logs can now be ommitted by setting `ad.datadoghq.com/<container_name>.logs_exclude` as an
    annotation on the pod.
