# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    APM: All spans can be sent through the error and rare samplers via custom feature flag `error_rare_sample_tracer_drop`. This can be useful if you want to run those samplers against traces that were not sampled by custom tracer sample rules. Note that even user manual drop spans may be kept if this feature flag is set.
deprecations:

    APM: The Rare Sampler is now disabled by default. If you wish to enable it explicitly you can set apm_config.enable_rare_sampler or DD_APM_ENABLE_RARE_SAMPLER to true.
