# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    This PR allows users to make the remote config org status
    polling interval that is defined here to be configurable.
    A user can pass a remote_configuration.org_status_refresh_interval
    config to configure the value as they wish, with a default of 1m if
    they do not provide this value (note: previous polling interval was
    also 1m, so no change in terms of default behavior).
