# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Improve utility functions which start or stop a service to better
    handle SERVICE_START_PENDING and SERVICE_STOP_PENDING states by simply
    waiting for the service to complete transition. It will help better
    handle Windows Agent concurrent execution of`agent.exe start` and
    `agent.exe restart` commands.
