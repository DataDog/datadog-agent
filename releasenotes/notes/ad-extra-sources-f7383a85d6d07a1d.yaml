# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    You can add extra listeners and config providers via the ``DD_EXTRA_LISTENERS`` and
    ``DD_EXTRA_CONFIG_PROVIDERS`` environment variables. They will be added on top of the
    ones defined in the ``listeners`` and ``config_providers`` section of the datadog.yaml
    configuration file.
