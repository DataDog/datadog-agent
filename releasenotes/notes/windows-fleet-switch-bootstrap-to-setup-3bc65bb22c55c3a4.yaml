upgrade:
  - |
    The PowerShell install script ``Install-Datadog.ps1`` now executes a different
    ``datadog-installer-x86_64.exe`` subcommand.

    If you always download a fresh ``Install-Datadog.ps1`` then no changes are needed.

    If you have a cached or modified copy of ``Install-Datadog.ps1`` then you must merge
    the latest changes or migrate to use the executable setup instead, see the features section for more information.

    ``Install-Datadog.ps1`` is now a light wrapper for downloading and executing ``datadog-installer-86_64.exe``, the rest of
    the setup responsibility has been moved into the executable.
features:
  - |
    The ``datadog-installer-x86_64.exe`` executable can now be used instead of the ``Install-Datadog.ps1`` PowerShell
    script. The executable is versioned and will only install that version. For example, to install Agent 7.71.0,
    download and run ``https://install.datadoghq.com/datadog-installer-7.71.0-1-x86_64.exe``.

    To install the latest stable Agent version, download and run ``https://install.datadoghq.com/datadog-installer-x86_64.exe``.

    To check the version, run ``.\datadog-installer-x86_64.exe version``.
