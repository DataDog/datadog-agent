# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Implemented a fix so that the Agent does not try to schedule the `orchestrator_kubelet_config` check when
    the `orchestrator_explorer.kubelet_config_check.enabled` config is
    set to `false`.
