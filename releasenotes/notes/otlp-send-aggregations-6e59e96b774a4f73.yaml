# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    When ``otlp_config.metrics.histograms.send_aggregation_metrics`` is set to ``true``, 
    the OTLP ingest pipeline will now send min and max metrics for delta OTLP Histograms 
    and OTLP Exponential Histograms when available, in addition to count and sum metrics.

    The deprecated option ``otlp_config.metrics.histograms.send_count_sum_metrics`` now
    also sends min and max metrics when available.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate ``otlp_config.metrics.histograms.send_count_sum_metrics`` in favor of ``otlp_config.metrics.histograms.send_aggregation_metrics``.
