# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Add new configuration option apm_config.require_tracer_hostname (or DD_APM_REQUIRE_TRACER_HOSTNAME). 
    Off by default, when enabled the agent will drop all tracer payloads that do not have a tagged hostname.
    This configuration is only useful in setups with the agent and traced application are on different hosts and
    it is desireable to strictly enforce tracer reporting of hostnames.
