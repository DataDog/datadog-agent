# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Introduce a way to configure the cardinality level of tags that
    the tagger should return. This is split between two options - one for
    checks and one for dogstatsd. The three cardinality levels are High,
    Orchestrator, and Low. Checks get Low and Orchestrator-level tags by default
    Dogstatsd benefits from Low-card tags only by default.
