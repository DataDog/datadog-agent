    Fix the `flare` command not being able to be created for the non-core agents (trace,
    network, ...) when running in a separated container, such as in Helm. A new
    option, `--local`, has been added to the `flare` command to force the
    creation of the archive using the local filesystem and not the one where
    the core agent process is in.
