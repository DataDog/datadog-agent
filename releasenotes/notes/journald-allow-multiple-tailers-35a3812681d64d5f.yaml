# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Journald launcher can now create multiple tailers on the same journal when 
    ``config_id`` is specified. This change enables multiple configs to operate 
    on the same journal which is useful for tagging different units. 
    Note: This may have an impact on CPU usage.
