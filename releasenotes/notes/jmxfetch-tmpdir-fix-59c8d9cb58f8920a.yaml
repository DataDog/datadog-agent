    Setting up a temporary directory for `JMXFetch  <https://github.com/DataDog/jmxfetch>`_ to use
    when it runs. Using the same one the Agent uses when running as this guarantees a directory where
    JMXFetch can write to. This helps when JMXFetch sends metrics over
    `Unix Domain Socket <https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/unix_socket/?tab=host>` as it needs
    access to a temp directory which it can write to.
