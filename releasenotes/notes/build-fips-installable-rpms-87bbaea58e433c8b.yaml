# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Build RPMs that can be installed in FIPS mode. This change doesn't affect SUSE RPMs.

    RPMs are now built with RPM 4.15.1 and have SHA256 digest headers, which are required by RPM on CentOS 8/RHEL 8 when running in FIPS mode.

    Note that newly built RPMs are no longer installable on CentOS 5/RHEL 5.
