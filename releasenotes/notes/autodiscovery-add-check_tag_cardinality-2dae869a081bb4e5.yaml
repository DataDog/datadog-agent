    Add `check_tag_cardinality` parameter config check.

    By default `check_tag_cardinality` is not set which doesn't change the behavior of the checks.
    Once it is set in pod annotaions, it overrides the cardinality value provided in the base agent configuration.
    Example of usage:
    ```yaml
    ad.datadoghq.com/redis.checks: |
      {
        "redisdb": {
          "check_tag_cardinality": "high", 
          "instances": [
            {
              "host": "%%host%%",
              "port": "6379"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ```
