    To prevent misconfigurations the Windows Datadog Agent installer now raises an error if
    the user account running the installer MSI is provided as the ``ddagentuser`` (``DDAGENTUSER_NAME``) account.
    If the account is a service account, such as LocalSystem or a gMSA account, then no action is needed.
    If the account is a regular account, provide the ``ALLOW_CURRENT_USER=true`` option to allow
    the installer to continue.
