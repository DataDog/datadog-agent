    To prevent misconfigurations, the Windows Datadog Agent installer now raises an error if
    the user account running the installer MSI is provided as the ``ddagentuser`` (``DDAGENTUSER_NAME``) account.
    If the account is a service account, such as LocalSystem or a gMSA account, no action is needed.
    If the account is a regular account, configure a different Datadog Agent service account.
