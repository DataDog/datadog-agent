# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Add support for span-derived primary tags in APM stats aggregation.
    This allows configuring tag keys via ``apm_config.span_derived_primary_tags``
    that will be extracted from span tags and used as additional aggregation
    dimensions for APM statistics.
