    Adds support for ``secret_backend_command_sha256`` SHA for the ``secret_backend_command`` executable. If ``secret_backend_command_sha256`` is used,
    the following restrictions are in place:
    - Value specified in the ``secret_backend_command`` setting must be an absolute path.
    - Permissions for the ``datadog.yaml`` config file must disallow write access by users other than ``ddagentuser`` or ``Administrators`` on Windows or the user running the Agent on Linux and macOS.
    The agent will refuse to start if the actual SHA256 of the ``secret_backend_command`` executable is different from the one specified by ``secret_backend_command_sha256``.
    The ``secret_backend_command`` file is locked during verification of SHA256 and subsequent run of the secret backend executable.
