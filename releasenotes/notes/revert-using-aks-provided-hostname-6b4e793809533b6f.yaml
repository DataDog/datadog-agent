# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Use of cloud-provided hostname as default when running the Agent
    in AKS introduced in `7.56.0` is reverted due to cases where the
    hostname returned is non-unique. This feature will be fixed and
    added again in a future release.
