    The Cluster Agent now enables both `CLUSTER_CHECKS_ADVANCED_DISPATCHING_ENABLED`
    and `CLUSTER_CHECKS_REBALANCE_WITH_UTILIZATION` by default.

    These options are now set to `true` in both the configuration template and the code,
    improving cluster check dispatching and balancing based on node utilization out of the box.

    To disable these features, user must now explicitly set them to `false` via the following config options:
      - name: DD_CLUSTER_CHECKS_ADVANCED_DISPATCHING_ENABLED
        value: "false"
      - name: DD_CLUSTER_CHECKS_REBALANCE_WITH_UTILIZATION
        value: "false"
