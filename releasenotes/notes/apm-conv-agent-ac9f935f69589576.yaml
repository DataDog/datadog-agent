# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: The Trace Agent now represents all Trace data internally using the new indexed trace format. Emitted traces will be attached to a new protobuf field ``idxTracerPayloads``.
    The primary changes of this change include: Automatic interning of strings to reduce memory usage and payload size, typed attributes for future extensibility, some common tags
    have been promoted to named fields, and Trace IDs are represented at the chunk level as bytes.
