    Windows: gopsutil calls to the CPU module require COM threading model to be
    in multi-threaded mode, to guarantee it's safe to make those calls we load

    we clear the concurrency mode and python checks that might use COM will set
    it as they need.

    Added developer documentation regarding the caveats of the COM concurrency
    model and its implications moving forward. The current state affects 
    auto-discovery and dynamic scheduling of checks.
