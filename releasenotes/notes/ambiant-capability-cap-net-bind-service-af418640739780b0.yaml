    **Agent**: The systemd units for the Datadog Agent now includes
    `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` to simplify binding to ports below
    1024 without running as root. If you do not require this capability, you can
    disable it by creating a systemd drop-in file
    (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/datadog-agent.service.d/disable-capability.conf`)
    with:
    ```
    [Service]
    AmbientCapabilities=
    ```.
