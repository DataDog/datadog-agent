    On linux the agent is now able to bind to ports below 1024 by default,
    simplifying common logs, SNMP and integrations configurations.
    This is done by setting `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` in the agent systemd units.

    If you wish to disable this, you can do so by creating a systemd drop-in file
    (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/datadog-agent.service.d/disable-capability.conf`)
    with:
    ```
    [Service]
    AmbientCapabilities=
    ```.
