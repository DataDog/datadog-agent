    The systemd units for the Datadog Agent now includes
    `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` to simplify binding to ports below
    1024 without running as root (common need for logs, SNMP traps and various integrations).
    If you do not require this capability, you can disable it by creating a systemd drop-in file
    (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/datadog-agent.service.d/disable-capability.conf`)
    with:
    ```
    [Service]
    AmbientCapabilities=
    ```.
