# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    Add a flag `enable_otel_compliant_translation` that can be added to apm_config.features to enable new translation logic that more closely aligns with the OpenTelemetry specification. If attributes are in the wrong place or collide with attributes in other locations, they will be prefixed - e.g. if env in set in both span and resource attributes, the span attribute will be renamed to otel.span.env.
  - |
    Add new methods to `pkg/opentelemetry-mapping-go/otlp/attributes` that translate attributes from OpenTelemetry to Datadog semantics.
