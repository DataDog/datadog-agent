# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    Add a stricter translation mode for OpenTelemetry traces, enabled by the `enable_otel_compliant_translation` feature flag. When active, attributes in incorrect locations are prefixed to prevent data loss; for example, an `env` attribute on a span becomes `otel.span.env`. A new metric, `datadog.trace_agent.otlp.misconfigured_attributes`, is now emitted to help identify affected traces.
  - |
    Add new methods to `pkg/opentelemetry-mapping-go/otlp/attributes` that translate attributes from OpenTelemetry to Datadog semantics.
