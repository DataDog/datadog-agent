# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    This regression was introduced in #41587 on Agent v7.73+.
    Impacts origin detection on cgroup v2 runtimes with DogStatsD, which led
    to tags not being enriched, even if origin detection was possible by
    using other methods like container ID from socket or ExternalData.
