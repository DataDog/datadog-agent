# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Logs Agent Check feature introduces a new subcommand (agent logs-analyze) within the Datadog Agent, 
    designed to help users test log configurations, regular expressions, and processing rules in isolation. 
    This feature provides a streamlined, cost-effective method for validating log configurations without 
    the need to run the entire Datadog Agent or send data to Datadog, allowing users to quickly identify configuration issues.
