# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Logs Agent Analyze feature introduces a new subcommand, `agent analyze-logs`, within the Datadog Agent. 
    This tool helps users test log configurations, regular expressions, and processing rules in isolation. 
    It offers a streamlined, cost-effective way to validate log configurations without 
    running the entire Datadog Agent or sending data to Datadog. This allows users to quickly identify configuration issues.
