upgrade:

    The setting 'ec2_prefer_imdsv2' now defaults to `true`. The Agent will now
    try to fetch a token from the IMDSv2 API by default to request EC2
    metadata. When IMDSv2 is not available, the Agent still automatically falls
    back on IMDSv1.
    Upon upgrading, this will change the hostname used by the Agent in cases
    where IMDSv2 was enforced on the AWS side but `ec2_prefer_imdsv2` was left to
    `false` (the Agent used to fail fetching the instance ID from IMDSv1 and
    would fall back on the system hostname). This can break monitors or
    dashboards using the old hostname.
    To keep the old behavior, set `ec2_prefer_imdsv2` to `false` in the Agent
    configuration.
