# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    If the retrieval of the AWS EC2 instance ID or hostname fails, previously-retrieved
    values are now sent, which should mitigate host aliases flapping issues in-app.
  - |
    Increase default timeout on AWS EC2 metadata endpoints, and make it configurable
    with ``ec2_metadata_timeout``
