# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Kubernetes pod with short-lived containers do not have log lines duplicated with both container tags (the stopped one and the running one) when logs are collected.
    This feature is enabled by default, set ``logs_config.validate_pod_container_id`` to ``false`` to disable it.
