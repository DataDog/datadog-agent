# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add RST linter for release notes. This linter validates that release notes use
    proper reStructuredText (RST) formatting instead of Markdown. It detects common
    Markdown patterns (links, bold, italic, code blocks) and validates reno section names.
    Run with ``dda inv linter.rst-releasenotes``.

    This is a message formatted in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to check
    if the linter properly catches the use of the `wrong syntax`.
