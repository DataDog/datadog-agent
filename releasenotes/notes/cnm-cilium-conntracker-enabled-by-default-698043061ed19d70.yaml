# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The cilium conntracker is now enabled by default
    in the system-probe, and now expects the /sys/fs/bpf
    to be mounted at /host/sys/fs/bpf in containerized
    environments. The conntracker, if enabled, will fail
    to load unless this mount is provided, with the log line
    "not loading cilium conntracker since cilium maps are not present"
    in system-probe's log file. Users who have enabled
    this feature can either upgrade to the latest helm
    chart or add this mount to their container
