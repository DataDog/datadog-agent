# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    On ec2 hosts that were upgraded from Agent 5.x using the install script or that have the ``hostname_fqdn`` option enabled if your hostname currently begins by ``ip-`` or ``domU-`` (default ec2 hostnames) your hostname will change to the ec2 instance ID.
    Example: ``ip-10-1-1-1.ec2.internal`` => ``i-1234567890abcdef0``.
    This is an effort to fix a bug in the hostname resolution that was intoduced in the version 6.3 of the agent.
