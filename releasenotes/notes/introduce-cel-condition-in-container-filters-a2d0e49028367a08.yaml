# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Adds `container_include_condition`, which lets you use conditional expressions to better specify which containers to monitor.

    More information about CEL, the conditional expression language used:

    https://github.com/google/cel-spec
    https://github.com/google/cel-go

    For example, you can use the following condition expressions in the configuration:

      ```
      name == 'eu_gcr' || name == 'private_jfrog'
      name == 'secret-container-dd' && image == 'docker-dd-agent'
      name.matches('secret-container-.*') && image == 'docker-dd-agent'
      ```

    The `container_include_condition` option is compatible with the `exclude_pause_container` option.
