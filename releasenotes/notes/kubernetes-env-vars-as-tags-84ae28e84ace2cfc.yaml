# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    annotations and labels. This can be set using the `kubernetes_container_env_as_tags` setting or
    `DD_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_ENV_AS_TAGS` environment variable.
