# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Agent can store traffic on disk when the in-memory retry queue of the 
    forwarder limit is reached. Enable this capability by setting 
    `forwarder_storage_max_size_in_bytes` to a positive value indicating 
    the maximum amount of storage space, in bytes, that the Agent can use 
    to store traffic on disk.
