# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed incorrect ``docker.cpu.shares`` metric values on cgroups v2 systems
    running runc >= 1.3.2 or crun >= 1.23. The new container runtimes use a
    different formula to convert CPU shares to cgroup v2 weight, which caused
    the Agent to report wrong values (e.g., 2597 instead of 1024 for default
    shares). The Agent now auto-detects which conversion formula the runtime
    uses and applies the correct inverse transformation.
