# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add a configuration option ``admission_controller.inject_config.inject_container_name`` to
    retrieve the container tags for dogstatsd metrics and apm traces in setups where origin detection is
    not supported (windows, nested virtualization with cgroupv2...).
    This option will inject the container name along with the pod uid in ``DD_ENTITY_ID`` if it was not set manually.
    Note that this option is disabled by default and is incompatible with prior versions of the agent . Thus, we
    recommend enabling it only if you are using the latest version of the agent.
    In case a rollback to an incompatible version is needed, it will be necessary to delete the pods in which
    ``DD_ENTITY_ID`` was injected by the latest agent to preserve pod tags in dogstatsd metrics and traces.
