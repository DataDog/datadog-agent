# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Files are not tailed in reverse lexicographical order w.r.t their file names then dir name. If you have files
    `/1/2017.log`, `/1/2018.log`, `/2/2018.log` and `logs_config.open_files_limit == 2`, then you will tail
    `/2/2018.log` and `/1/2018.log`.
