# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

features:
  - |
    Added a new Rust-based compression library as the default compression implementation.
    The Rust implementation provides improved performance for zstd, gzip, and zlib compression,
    using a zero-copy API to minimize memory allocations. This is enabled by default when
    CGO is available. To use the previous Go-based implementation, build with the
    ``no_rust_compression`` build tag.
enhancements:
  - |
    The compression subsystem now uses a zero-copy ``CompressInto`` API that writes directly
    to caller-provided buffers, reducing memory allocations and improving throughput.
    The new implementation is thread-safe, with mutex protection ensuring safe concurrent
    use from multiple goroutines.
