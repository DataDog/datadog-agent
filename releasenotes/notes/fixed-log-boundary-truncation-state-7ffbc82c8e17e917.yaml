# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed a bug where log lines exactly at the ``logs_config.max_message_size_bytes``
    limit (default 900KB) were incorrectly marked as truncated. This caused the
    ``...TRUNCATED...`` marker to appear in logs that fit within the size limit,
    and incorrectly marked the subsequent log line as a truncated remainder.
    Additionally, improved truncation detection by extending the FrameMatcher interface
    to explicitly signal when content is truncated, ensuring consistent truncation state
    across the framer and handler components.
