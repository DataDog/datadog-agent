    Agent discovers by itself which container AD features and checks should be
    scheduled without having to specify any configuration. This works for
    Docker, Containerd, ECS/EKS Fargate and Kubernetes.
    It also allows to support heterogeneous nodes with a single configuration
    (for instance a Kubernetes DaemonSet could cover nodes running Containerd
    and/or Docker - activating relevant configuration depending on node
    configuration).
    This feature is activated by default and can be de-activated by setting
    environment variable `AUTCONFIG_FROM_ENVIRONMENT=false`.
