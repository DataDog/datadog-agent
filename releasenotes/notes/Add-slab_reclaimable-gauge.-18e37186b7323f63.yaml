    Adds a gauge for `system.mem.slab_reclaimable`. This is part of slab
    memory that might be reclaimed (i.e. caches). Datadog 7.x adds
    `SReclaimable` memory, if available on the system, to the
    `system.mem.cached` gauge by default. This may lead to inconsistent
    metrics for clients migrating from Datadog 5.x, where
    `system.mem.cached` didn't include `SReclaimable` memory. Adding a gauge
    for `system.mem.slab_reclaimable` allows inverse calculation to remove
    this value from the `system.mem.cached` gauge.
