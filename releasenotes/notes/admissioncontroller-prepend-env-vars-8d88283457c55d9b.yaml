# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    When injecting env vars with the admission controller, env
    vars are now prepended instead of appended, meaning that 
    Kubernetes [dependent environment variables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-interdependent-environment-variables/)
    can now depend on these injected vars.
