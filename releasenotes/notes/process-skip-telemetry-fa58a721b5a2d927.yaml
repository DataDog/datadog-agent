    Process Agent: Add ``datadog.process.processes.skipped`` metric with a
    ``reason`` tag (``short_lived``, ``disallow_listed``, ``zombie``) to provide
    visibility into processes skipped during collection. Processes must be
    observed in two consecutive collection cycles to be reported, so processes
    living less than approximately 20 seconds may not be captured.
