# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Set the source of kubernetes events to specific integrations based
    on controller name if known. All kubernetes events will have the
    tag ``true_source:kubernetes``. For controller names that do not
    match any of the known integrations, the source will still be set
    to ``kubernetes`` by default.
