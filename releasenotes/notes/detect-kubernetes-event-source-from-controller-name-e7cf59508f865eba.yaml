# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Adds config ``kubernetes_events_source_detection.enabled`` which is
    false by default. When set to true, this sets the source of kubernetes
    events to specific integrations based on the name of the controller
    that emitted it. All kubernetes events will have the tag
    ``orchestrator:kubernetes``. For controller names that do not match
    any of the known integrations, the source will still be set to
    ``kubernetes`` by default.
