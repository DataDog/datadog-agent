# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The `datadog-fips-agent` now builds with the ['requirefips' buildtag](https://github.com/microsoft/go/tree/microsoft/main/eng/doc/fips#build-option-to-require-fips-mode)
    in the 7.64 Linux release and no longer needs the `GOFIPS=1` environment
    variable set to enable FIPS mode. When upgrading from 7.63, this can be removed.
