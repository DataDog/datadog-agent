    system-probe will now attempt to read `datadog.yaml` from the same directory as `system-probe.yaml`.
    Previously, system-probe would always use the default configuration directory to read `datadog.yaml`.
    If you need to specify a different directory for `datadog.yaml`, you may use the `--datadogcfgpath` CLI argument to system-probe.
