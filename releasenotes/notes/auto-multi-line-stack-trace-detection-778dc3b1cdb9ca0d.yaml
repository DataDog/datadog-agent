# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Auto multi-line log detection now recognizes non-timestamped stack trace
    start markers from Go (``goroutine N [status]:`` and ``panic:``), Java
    (``Exception in thread``), and Rust (``thread '<name>' panicked at``).
    These patterns are emitted directly to stderr by language runtimes and were
    previously missed by the timestamp-based detector, causing stack traces to
    be split across multiple log entries.
    The feature is enabled by default when auto multi-line detection is active
    and can be toggled globally with
    ``logs_config.auto_multi_line.enable_stack_trace_detection`` or per
    integration via the ``enable_stack_trace_detection`` option in
    ``auto_multi_line_extra_patterns``.
