# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added new DogStatsD configuration option "dogstatsd_flush_incomplete_buckets". 
    When enabled, DogStatsD will flush all received metrics during shutdown, regardless
    of which time-interval based bucket they belong to.
