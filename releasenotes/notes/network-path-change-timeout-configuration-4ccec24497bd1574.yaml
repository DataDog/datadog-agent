# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Changes behavior of the timeout for Network Path. Previously, the timeout
    signified the total time to wait for a full traceroute to complete. Now,
    the timeout signifies the time to wait for each hop in the traceroute.
    Additionally, the default timeout has been changed to 1000ms.
