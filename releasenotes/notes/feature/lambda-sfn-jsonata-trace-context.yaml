    Improved trace context creation from Step Function execution context:
    - Now utilizes `State.RetryCount` and `Execution.RedriveCount` to generate parent IDs deterministically, preventing collisions with retry spans.
    - Supports multi-level trace merging, allowing an arbitrary number of Lambda and Step Function traces to be linked together while maintaining root context.

    This update brings feature parity with Node and Python Lambda layers in the Universal runtimes.
