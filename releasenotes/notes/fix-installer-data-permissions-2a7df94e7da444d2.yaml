    Permissions are no longer applied recursively to the Datadog installer
    data directory on Windows.

    This fixes an issue that causes Agent updates to restrict access to the
    .NET APM tracer libraries that were previously installed by the
    ``DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_LIBRARIES`` option, preventing them from being
    loaded by IIS.
