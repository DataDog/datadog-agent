# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added eBPF support for the `prctl` syscall. The following fields are now collected:
      - `prctl.option`: The option value used in the syscall.
      - `prctl.new_name`: If the option is `PR_SET_NAME`, the new process name.
      - `prctl.is_name_truncated`: If the option is `PR_SET_NAME`, indicates whether the retrieved name was truncated. A metric also tracks the number of truncated names.
