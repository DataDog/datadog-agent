# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Integration check failures are now automatically reported to the Agent Health Platform component
    when enabled via ``health_platform.enabled: true``. This provides structured health issue tracking with:

    * Detailed error context including check name, error message, and configuration source
    * Actionable remediation steps for debugging check failures
    * Automatic issue resolution when checks recover
    * Integration with the health platform telemetry and reporting system

    This feature helps users proactively identify and troubleshoot integration issues across their fleet.
