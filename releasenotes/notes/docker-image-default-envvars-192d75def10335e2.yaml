    Docker image: we moved the default configuration from the docker image's default
    environment variables to the `datadog-*.yaml` files. This allows users to easily
    mount a custom `datadog.yaml` configuration file to set all options.
    If you already did so, you will need to update your `datadog.yaml` to include
    these new defaults. If you only used envvars, no change is needed.
