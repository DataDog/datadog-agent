# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Review the retry strategy used by the agent to connect to external services like docker, kubernetes API server, kubelet, etc.
    In case of failure to connect to them, the agent used to retry every 30 seconds 10 times and then, to give up.
    The agent will now retry after 1 second. It will then double the period between two consecutive retries each time, up to 5 minutes.
    So, After 10 minutes, the agent will keep on retrying every 5 minutes instead of completely giving up after 5 minutes.
    This change will avoid to have to restart the agent if it started in an environment that remains degraded for a while (docker being down for several minutes for example.)
