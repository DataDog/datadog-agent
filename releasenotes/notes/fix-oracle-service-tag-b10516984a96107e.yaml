# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Breaking change - Fixes the Oracle service name tag to be `service_name` instead of
    `service`. This corrects the conflict with the APM `service` tag.
    This is a breaking change for any users who had been relying on
    the `service` tag to be set to the Oracle service name. The `service`
    tag can still be set explicitly in the tags configuration if needed.
