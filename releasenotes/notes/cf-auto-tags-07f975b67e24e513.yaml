# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - Leverage Cloud Foundry application metadata to automatically tag Cloud Foundry containers.
    A label or annotation prefixed with ``tags.datadoghq.com/`` is automatically picked up and used to tag the application container when the cluster agent is configured to query the CC API.
