fixes:
  - |
    Fix cases where empty host tags in the Agent ``datadog.yaml`` configuration caused
    the host metadata payload parsing to fail in the backend.
  - |
    Fix ``resources`` metadata collector so that its payload is correctly parsed in the
    backend even when empty.
other:
  - |
    Only enable the ``resources`` metadata collector on Linux by default, to match
    Agent 5's behavior.
