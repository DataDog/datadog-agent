    The `overlay_numlower` integer attribute that was reported for files
    and executables was unreliable. It was replaced by a simple boolean
    attribute named `in_upper_layer` that is set to true when a file
    is either only on the upper layer of an overlayfs filesystem, or
    is an altered version of a file present in a base layer.
