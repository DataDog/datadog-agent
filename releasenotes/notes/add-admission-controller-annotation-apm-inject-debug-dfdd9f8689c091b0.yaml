# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add ``admission.datadoghq.com/apm-inject.debug: "true"`` annotation to inject
    ``DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_DEBUG=true``, ``DD_TRACE_STARTUP_LOGS=true`` and
    ``DD_TRACE_DEBUG=true`` to an application container.
    This is useful for debugging Single Step Instrumentation or tracer issues
    in Kubernetes environments.
