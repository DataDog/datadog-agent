# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:

    Unified ``agent diagnose`` CLI command by removing ``all``,
    ``datadog-connectivity``, and ``metadata-availability`` subcommands.
    These separate subcommands became one of the diagnose suites. The
    ``all`` subcommand became unnecessary.

upgrade:
  - |
    ``datadog-connectivity`` and ``metadata-availability`` subcommands
    do not exist anymore and their diagnoses are reported in a more
    general and structured way.

    Diagnostics previously reported via ``datadog-connectivity``
    subcommand will be reported now as part of
    ``connectivity-datadog-core-endpoints``suite. Correspondingly,
    diagnostics previously reported via ``metadata-availability``
    subcommand will be reported now as part of
    ``connectivity-datadog-autodiscovery`` suite.
