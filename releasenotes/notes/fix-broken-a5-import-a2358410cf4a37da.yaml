# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Agent 5 configuration import was missing critical parameters.
    The configuration was reset to default settings in the middle
    of the migration process. It was leading to many unimported
    parameters including very important ones like ``api_key``.
    Some Docker & Kubernetes configuration settings were also
    imported in wrongly located files.
