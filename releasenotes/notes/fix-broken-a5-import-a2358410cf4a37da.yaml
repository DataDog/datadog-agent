# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix bugs introduced in 7.20.0/6.20.0 in the Agent 5 configuration import command:
    the command would not import some Agent config settings, including ``api_key``,
    and would write some Docker & Kubernetes config settings to wrongly-located files.
