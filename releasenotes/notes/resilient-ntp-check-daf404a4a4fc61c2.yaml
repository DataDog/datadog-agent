# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The ntp check will now query multiple servers by default to be more
    resilient to servers returning wrong offsets. A now config option ``hosts``
    is now available in the ntp check configuration file to allow users to change
    the list of ntp servers.
