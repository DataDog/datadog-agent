# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add a new environment variable ``DD_API_KEY_FILE`` that allows to put the API in a file
    rather than directly in an environment variable. This allows to put API key in a docker secret volume.
