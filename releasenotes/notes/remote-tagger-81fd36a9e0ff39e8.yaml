# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The core agent now exposes a gRPC API to expose tags to the other agents.
    The following settings are now introduced to allow each of the agents to use
    this API (they all default to false):

    - apm_config.remote_tagger
    - logs_config.remote_tagger
    - process_config.remote_tagger
