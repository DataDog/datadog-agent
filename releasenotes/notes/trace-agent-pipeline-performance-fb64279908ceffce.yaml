# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM - This change improves the acceptance and queueing strategy for trace
    payloads sent to the Trace Agent. These changes create a system of
    backpressure in the Trace Agent, causing it to reject payloads when it
    cannot keep up with the rate of traffic, rather than buffering and causing
    OOM issues.

    This change has been shown to increase overall throughput in the Trace Agent
    while decreasing peak resource usage. Existing configurations for CPU and
    memory work at least as well, and often better, with these changes compared to previous Agent versions. This means users do not have to adjust
    their configuration to take advantage of these changes, and they do not
    experience performance degredation as a result of upgrading.
