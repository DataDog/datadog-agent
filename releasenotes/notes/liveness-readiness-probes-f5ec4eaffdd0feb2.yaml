# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Expose distinct endpoints for liveness and readiness probes.
    * The liveness probe (``/live``) fails in case of unrecoverable error that deserve
      an agent restart. (Ex.: goroutine deadlock or premature exit)
    * The readiness probe (``/ready``) fails in case of recoverable errors or errors
      for which an agent restart would be more nasty than useful
      (Ex.: the forwarder fails to connect to DataDog)
