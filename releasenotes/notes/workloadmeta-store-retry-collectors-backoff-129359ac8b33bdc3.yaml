# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Changes the retry mechanism of starting workloadmeta collectors so that
    instead of retrying every 30 seconds, it retries following an exponential
    backoff with initial interval of 1s and max of 30s. In general, this should
    help start sooner the collectors that failed on the first try.
