# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

fixes:
  - |
    Populate OTLP resource attributes in Datadog logs
  - |
    Changes mapping for jvm.loaded_classes from process.runtime.jvm.classes.loaded to process.runtime.jvm.classes.current_loaded
  - |
    The minimum and maximum estimation for OTLP Histogram to Datadog distribution mapping now ensures the average is within [min, max]. 
  - |
    This estimation is only used when the minimum and maximum are not available in the OTLP payload or this is a cumulative payload.
