# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add a new ``azure_metadata_api_version`` configuration option to allow customers
    to specify the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) API version used by the Agent.
    The default value is now ``2021-02-01``. This setting can be configured via
    ``azure_metadata_api_version`` in ``datadog.yaml`` or the ``DD_AZURE_METADATA_API_VERSION``
    environment variable.
