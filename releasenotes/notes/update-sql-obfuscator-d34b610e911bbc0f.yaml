# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Major update to the SQL obfuscator. SQL queries should now be
    much more representative of the original query that they came from.
    The two major changes are:

    The SQL obfuscator now preserves certain whitespace around
    identifiers. For example, what was previously
    'select [ user ] . [ name ] from [ users ] ;'
    is now
    'select [user].[name] from [users];'

    The SQL obfuscator now preserves quotes around identifiers. For
    example,
    'select `user` where id = 42;'
    used to be obfuscated as
    'select user where id = ?;'
    The output is now
    'select `user` where id = ?;'.
    
    Users may need to update any monitoring or metrics queries based on
    specific SQL queries, as they may be affected by this change.
    Specifically, monitors or metrics based on the resource name of a SQL
    span may need to be updated for the new query.
