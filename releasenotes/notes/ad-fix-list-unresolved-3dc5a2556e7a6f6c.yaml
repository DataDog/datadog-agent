# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The ``agent configcheck --verbose`` command and flares now include a section
    that lists all collected configurations, both matched and unmatched. This
    addition aids debugging by revealing which configurations the Agent has
    detected.
