    The Agent MSI no longer fails when it is unable to read the
    version information from [MsiGetProductInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/msi/nf-msi-msigetproductinfow).

    When upgrading from an Agent version earlier than 7.56, a failure in ``MsiGetProductInfo``, combined with an MSI rollback, may result in missing system drivers.
    If this occurs, repairing or reinstalling the Agent will restore the missing drivers.
    This issue is typically caused by a corrupted Windows Installer registry.
    To repair these issues, refer to the
    [Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d).
