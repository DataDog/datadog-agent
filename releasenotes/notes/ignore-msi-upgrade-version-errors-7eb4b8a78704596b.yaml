    The Agent MSI no longer fails when it is unable to read the
    version information from [MsiGetProductInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/msi/nf-msi-msigetproductinfow).

    When upgrading from an Agent version lower than 7.56,
    if ``MsiGetProductInfo`` fails and the MSI fails and rolls back, then
    the system may be missing some drivers. If this happens, repair
    or reinstall the Agent to restore the missing drivers.
    These cases are usually caused by a corrupted Windows Installer registry.
    To repair these issues, refer to the
    [Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d).
