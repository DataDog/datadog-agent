# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix the default value of the configuration option ``forwarder_storage_path`` when ``run_path`` is set.
    The default value is ``RUN_PATH/transactions_to_retry`` where RUN_PATH is defined by the configuration option ``run_path``.
