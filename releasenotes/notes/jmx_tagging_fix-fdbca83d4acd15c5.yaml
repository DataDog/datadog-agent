# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Provide the actual JMX check name as `check_name` in configurations 
    provided to JMXFetch via the agent API. This addresses a regression
    in 6.3.0 that broke the `instance:` tag.
    Due to the nature of the regression, and the fix, this will cause
    churn on the tag potentially affecting dashboards and monitors.
