# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Agent now includes a Python 3 runtime to run checks.
    By default, the Python 2 runtime is used. See the dedicated `Agent documentation page
    <https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/python-3/>`_ for details on how to
    configure the Agent to use the Python 3 runtime and how to migrate checks from
    Python 2 to Python 3.
