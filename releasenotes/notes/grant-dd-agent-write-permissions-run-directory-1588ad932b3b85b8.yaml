      In the Agent and Cluster Agent Docker images, the `/opt/datadog-agent/run` directory is now owned by the
      `dd-agent` user and writable by the `root` group. This allows the Agent to function correctly (e.g.,
      using Remote Configuration) when running as the non-root `dd-agent` user (UID 100).
