# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The `sql.query` tag will now always be obfuscated by the Datadog Agent
    even if this tag was already set by a tracer or manually by a customer.
    This is to prevent potentially sensitive data from being sent to Datadog.
    If you wish to have a raw, unobfuscated query within a span, then
    manually add a span tag of a different name (e.g. `sql.rawquery`)
