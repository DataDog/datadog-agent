# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix a panic in the log agent when the auto-discovery reports new containers to monitor
    and the agent fails to connect to the docker daemon.
    The main setup where this happened is on ECS Fargate where the ECS auto-discovery is watching
    for new containers and the docker socket is not available from the datadog agent.
