# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Metric payloads are compressed using `zstd` compression by default.
    This may be breaking for users who are sending metrics to systems other
    than Datadog, such as Vector prior to version 0.40 or proxy servers that
    need to decode requests. The setting can be reverted to the previous
    compression kind by adding ``serializer_compressor_kind: zlib`` to the
    configuration.
