# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Metric payloads are compressed using `zstd` compression by default.
    This can be reverted to the previous compression kind by adding
    ``serializer_compressor_kind: zlib`` to the configuration.
