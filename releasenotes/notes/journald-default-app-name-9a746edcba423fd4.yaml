# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added a new, optional configuration setting for journald logs: ``default_application_name``.
    If set to a non-empty string, the value will replace "docker" as the default application
    name for contained based journald logs.
    If set to an empty string, the application name will be determined by the systemd journal fields,
    like all non-container based journald logs.
