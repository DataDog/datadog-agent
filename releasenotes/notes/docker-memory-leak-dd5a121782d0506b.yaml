    Fixes a memory leak when the Agent is running in Docker environments. This
    leak resulted in memory usage growing linearly, corresponding with the
    amount of containers ever ran while the current Agent process was also
    running. Long-lived Agent processes on nodes with a lot of container churn
    would cause the Agent to eventually run out of memory.
