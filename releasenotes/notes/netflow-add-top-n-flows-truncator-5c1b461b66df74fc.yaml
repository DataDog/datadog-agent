# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    [pkg/netflow] Add a new config option `network.netflow.aggregator_max_flows_per_flush_interval` that controls the
    maximum number of flows to be sent in a flush interval. Only sends the top flows, by # of bytes in the period up to
    the value in the config.
