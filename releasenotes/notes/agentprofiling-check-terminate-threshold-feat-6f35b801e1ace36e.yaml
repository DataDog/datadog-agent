# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Agent Profiling check now supports automatic Agent termination after flare generation when memory or CPU thresholds are exceeded. This feature is useful in resource-constrained environments where the Agent needs to be restarted after generating diagnostic information.

    Enable this feature by setting `terminate_agent_on_threshold: true` in the Agent Profiling check configuration. When enabled, the Agent uses its established shutdown mechanism to trigger graceful shutdown after successfully generating a flare, ensuring proper cleanup before exit.

    **Warning**: This feature will cause the Agent to exit. This feature is disabled by default and should be used with caution.
