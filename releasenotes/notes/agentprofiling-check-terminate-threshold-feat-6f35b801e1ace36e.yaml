# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# must be readable independently of the other.

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Agent Profiling check now supports automatic agent termination after flare generation when memory or CPU thresholds are exceeded. This feature is useful in resource-constrained environments where the agent needs to be restarted after generating diagnostic information.

    Enable this feature by setting ``terminate_agent_on_threshold: true`` in the Agent Profiling check configuration. When enabled, the agent will attempt a graceful shutdown via SIGINT after successfully generating a flare, allowing cleanup before exit. If signal delivery fails, it will fall back to immediate termination.

    **Warning**: This feature will cause the agent to exit. This feature is disabled by default and should be used with caution.
