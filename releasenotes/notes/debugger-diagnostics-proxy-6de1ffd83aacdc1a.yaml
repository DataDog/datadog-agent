    Add Dynamic Instrumentation diagnostics proxy endpoint to the trace-agent http server.

    At present, diagnostics are forwarded through the debugger endpoint on the trace-agent server to logs.
    Since Dynamic Instrumentation also allows adding dynamic metrics and dynamic spans, we want to remove the
    dependency on logs for diagnostics - the new endpoint uploads diagnostic messages on a dedicated track.
