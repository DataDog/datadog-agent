    If you use a custom Agent username and password on Windows with an Active
    Directory domain account and you want to remotely upgrade the Agent using
    Fleet Automation then you must provide the ``DDAGENTUSER_PASSWORD``
    option when upgrading to 7.66 or later. For more information see the features release notes.

    Fleet Automation now supports remote upgrades when using a custom Agent username and password on Windows.

    Windows stores the password as an encrypted LSA local private data object that is only accessible
    to local Administrators. Windows Service Manager stores service account passwords in the same location.
    For more information, see the Microsoft documentation on
    [Storing Private Data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secmgmt/storing-private-data)
    and
    [Private Data Objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secmgmt/private-data-object).

    Uninstalling the Agent removes the encrypted password from the LSA.

    To avoid providing and manually managing the account password, consider using a
    [Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview).
    For more information, see [Installing the Agent with a gMSA account](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/basic_agent_usage/windows/?tab=installationinactivedirectorydomains).
