# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Removed the deprecated config option ``otlp_config.debug.loglevel`` in favor of ``otlp_config.debug.verbosity``:
    * ``loglevel: debug`` maps to ``verbosity: detailed``
    * ``loglevel: info`` maps to ``verbosity: normal``
    * ``loglevel: warn/error`` maps to ``verbosity: basic``
    * ``loglevel: disabled`` maps to ``verbosity: none``
