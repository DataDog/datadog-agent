# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

    Consider static pods as ready, even though their status is never updated in the pod list.
    This creates the risk of running checks against pods that are not actually ready, but this
    is necessary to make autodiscovery work on static pods (which are used in standard kops
    deployments for example).
