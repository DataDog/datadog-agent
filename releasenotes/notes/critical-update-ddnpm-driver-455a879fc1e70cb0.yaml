    Fixed a limited out-of-bounds memory read and DoS vulnerability in Windows kernel driver while handling TLS traffic.
    The host must have the ddnpm kernel driver service running, by having system_probe_config and network_config enabled, to be affected.
    This configuration is not enabled by default.
    Query with PowerShell: Get-Service ddnpm
    Query with command prompt: sc query ddnpm
