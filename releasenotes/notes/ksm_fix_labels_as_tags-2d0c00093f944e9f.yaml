# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes the `labelsAsTags` parameter of the kube-state metrics core check.
    Tags were not properly formatted when they came from a label on one resource type (for example, namespace) and turned into a tag on another resource type (for example, pod).
