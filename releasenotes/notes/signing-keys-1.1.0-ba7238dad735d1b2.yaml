# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The datadog-agent, datadog-iot-agent and datadog-dogstatsd deb packages
    now have a versioned weak dependency on the datadog-signing-keys package
    version 1.1.0, instead of an unversioned weak dependency.
