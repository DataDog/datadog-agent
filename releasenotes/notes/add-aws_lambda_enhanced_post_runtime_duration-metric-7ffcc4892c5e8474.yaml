# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Adds new `aws.lambda.enhanced.post_runtime_duration` metric for AWS Lambda
    functions. This gauge metric measures the elapsed milliseconds from when
    the function returns the response to when the extensions finishes. This
    includes performing activities like sending telemetry data to a preferred
    destination after the function's response is returned. Note that
    `aws.lambda.enhanced.duration` is equivalent to the sum of
    `aws.lambda.enhanced.runtime_duration` and
    `aws.lambda.enhanced.post_runtime_duration`.
