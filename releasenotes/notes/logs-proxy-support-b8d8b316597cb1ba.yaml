# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added dedicated configuration parameters to send logs to a proxy by TCP.
    Note that 'logs_config.dd_url', 'logs_config.dd_port' and 'logs_config.dev_mode_no_ssl' are deprecated and will be unvailable soon,
    use the new parameters 'logs_config.logs_dd_url' and 'logs_config.logs_no_ssl' instead.
