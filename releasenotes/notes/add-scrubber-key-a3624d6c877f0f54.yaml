# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    **Scrubber**: Added support for additional sensitive keys in configuration scrubbing:
    
    * HTTP header-style API keys with "key" suffix: ``x-seel-api-key``, ``x-goog-api-key``, ``x-sonar-passcode``
    * HTTP header-style API keys with "token" suffix: ``x-consul-token``, ``x-datadog-monitor-token``, ``x-vault-token``, ``x-vtex-api-apptoken``, ``x-static-token``
    * HTTP header-style API keys with "secret" suffix: ``x-api-secret``, ``x-ibm-client-secret``, ``x-chalk-client-secret``
    * Exact key matches: ``cookie``, ``private-token``, ``kong-admin-token``, ``accesstoken``, ``session_token``
    
    These keys will now be automatically scrubbed from configuration files, logs, and other sensitive data to prevent accidental exposure of credentials.
