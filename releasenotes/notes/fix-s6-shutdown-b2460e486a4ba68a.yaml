# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix S6 behavior when the core agent dies.
    When the core agent died in a multi-process agent container managed by S6,
    the container stayed in an unhealthy half dead state.
    S6 configuration has been modified so that it will now exit in case of
    core agent death so that the whole container will exit and will be restarted.
