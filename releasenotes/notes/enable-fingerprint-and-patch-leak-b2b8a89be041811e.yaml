# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed a file descriptor leak in the log file tailer where rotated tailers
    were not being properly removed from the active tailer container, causing
    them to remain active indefinitely. Rotated tailers now drain their remaining
    content while allowing new tailers to be created for the rotated file.
