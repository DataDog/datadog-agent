    Add flag `histogram_copy_to_distribution` to send histogram metric values
    as distributions automatically. Note that the distributions feature is in
    beta. An additional flag `histogram_copy_to_distribution_prefix` modifies
    the existing histogram metric name by adding a prefix, e.g. `dist.`, to
    better distinguish between these values.
