# Each section from every release note is combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: The rare sampler can now be disabled using the environment variable DD_APM_DISABLE_RARE_SAMPLER
    or the `apm_config.disable_rare_sampler` configuration. By default the rare sampler catches 5 extra trace chunks
    per second on top of the head base sampling.
    The TPS is spread to catch all combinations of service, name, resource, http.status, error.type missed by 
    head base sampling.
