# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Enhanced fingerprinting configuration with file-specific overrides and improved fallback behavior. 
    `logs_config.fingerprint_config` can now be set on a per-source and global basis, as either [disabled, line_checksum, byte_checksum].

    File-specific configurations take precedence over global settings, with automatic fallback to global config when file configs
    are missing or incomplete.
