# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Upgraded JMXFetch to `0.47.10 <https://github.com/DataDog/jmxfetch/releases/0.47.10>`.
    This version improves how JMXFetch communicates with the Agent, and fixes a race condition
    where an exception is thrown if the Agent hasn't finished initializing before JMXFetch starts to shut down.
