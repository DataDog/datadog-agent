# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

features:
  - |
    A new product, ASM_FEATURES, was added to replace the FEATURES product, which
    was used for ASM activation. It holds the same configuration as FEATURES used to.
deprecations:
  - |
    The FEATURES product is no longer used for ASM activation configs. ASM_FEATURES
    should be used for this instead. FEATURES has been removed since switching to
    ASM_FEATURES means FEATURES is not used for anything anymore (yet).
