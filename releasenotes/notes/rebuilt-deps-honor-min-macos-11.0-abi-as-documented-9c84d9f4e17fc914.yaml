# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    All internally rebuilt `x86_64` dependencies now uniformly target the documented macOS 11.0 minimal ABI.
    Previously, some still targeted macOS 10.12 or 10.13, even though support for 10.x was dropped in Agent 7.62.0 and
    numerous `x86_64` dependencies were already targeting newer ABI versions.
