# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    either through 403 responses or periodic API key validation. The refresh rate is throttled by 
    `secret_refresh_on_api_key_failure_interval` configuration option (in minutes).
