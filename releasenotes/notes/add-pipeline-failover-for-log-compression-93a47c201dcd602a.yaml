    Logs pipeline failover: Added automatic failover capability to prevent log loss when compression blocks pipelines.
    When a pipeline becomes blocked during compression, log messages are automatically routed to healthy pipelines.
    Messages from the same source are consistently routed to the same primary pipeline via origin hashing.
    Enable with ``logs_config.pipeline_failover.enabled: true`` (default: false).
    When all pipelines are blocked, backpressure is applied to prevent data loss.
