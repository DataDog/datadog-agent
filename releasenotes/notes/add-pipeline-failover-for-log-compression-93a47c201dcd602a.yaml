    Logs pipeline failover: Added automatic failover capability to prevent log loss when compression blocks pipelines.
    When a pipeline becomes blocked during compression, log messages are automatically routed to healthy pipelines.
    Enable with ``logs_config.pipeline_failover.enabled: true`` (default: false).
    Configure timeout with ``logs_config.pipeline_failover.timeout_ms`` (default: 10ms).
    When all pipelines are blocked, backpressure is applied to prevent data loss.
