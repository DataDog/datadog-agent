# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes using ReplicaSet creation time for rollout duration, because rollbacks reuse existing ReplicaSets,
    causing durations to show as hours/days instead of the actual rollback time. The fix tracks revision annotation
    changes and resets the start time to now when a rollback is detected.
