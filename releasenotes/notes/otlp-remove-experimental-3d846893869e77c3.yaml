# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    OTLP ingest: Support for the deprecated ``experimental.otlp`` section and the ``DD_OTLP_GRPC_PORT`` and ``DD_OTLP_HTTP_PORT`` environment variables has been removed. Use the ``otlp_config`` section or the ``DD_OTLP_CONFIG_RECEIVER_PROTOCOLS_GRPC_ENDPOINT`` and ``DD_OTLP_CONFIG_RECEIVER_PROTOCOLS_HTTP_ENDPOINT`` environment variables instead.
