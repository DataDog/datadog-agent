# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

features:
  - Added a new feature flag `enable_operation_and_resource_name_logic_v2` in DD_APM_FEATURES. When this flag is enabled, the logic for computing operation and resource names from OTLP spans is modified to create shorter and more readable names and to better align with OpenTelemetry specifications.
