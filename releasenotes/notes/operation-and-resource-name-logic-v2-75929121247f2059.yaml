# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

features:
  - Added a new feature flag `enable_operation_and_resource_name_logic_v2` in DD_APM_FEATURES. Enabling this flag modifies the logic for computing operation and resource names from OTLP spans to produce shorter, more readable names and improve alignment with OpenTelemetry specifications.
