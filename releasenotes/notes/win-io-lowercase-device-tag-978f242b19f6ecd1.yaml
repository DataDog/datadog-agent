# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add ``lowercase_device_tag`` option to the system ``io`` core check on Windows.
    When enabled, sends metrics with a lowercased ``device`` tag, which is consistent with the
    ``system.io.*`` metrics of Agent v5 and the ``system.disk.*`` metrics of all Agent
    versions.
