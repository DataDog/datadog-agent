# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Private Action Runner now supports Datadog's secret management features.
    It can now resolve secrets using the ``ENC[...]`` notation in configuration files,
    supporting all secret backends via ``secret_backend_type`` and
    ``secret_backend_config`` settings.
