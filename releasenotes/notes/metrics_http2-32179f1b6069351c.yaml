# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    connection handling to take full advantage of this means multiple requests
    can be in flight at any one time. This can be configured with the
    ``forwarder_max_concurrent_requests`` option, default is 10.
