# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    ``max_message_size_bytes`` can now be configured in ``logs_config``. This allows the default message
    content limit of 256,000 bytes to be increased up to 1MB. If a log line is larger than this byte limit,
    the overflow bytes will be truncated.
