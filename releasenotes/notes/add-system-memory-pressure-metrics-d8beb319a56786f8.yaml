# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The system memory check on Linux can now collect memory pressure metrics
    from /proc/vmstat to help detect memory pressure before OOM events occur.
    To enable, set ``collect_memory_pressure: true`` in the memory check configuration.
    New metrics: ``system.mem.allocstall`` (with ``zone`` tag),
    ``system.mem.pgscan_direct``, ``system.mem.pgsteal_direct``,
    ``system.mem.pgscan_kswapd``, ``system.mem.pgsteal_kswapd``.
