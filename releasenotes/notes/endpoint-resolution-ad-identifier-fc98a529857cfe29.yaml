# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    defined in files or configmaps. This enables static pod check configurations
    to correctly resolve the endpoint by setting resolve method to "ip".
