# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    advanced AD identifiers for kube endpoint check configurations
    defined in files or configmaps. Allows static pod check configurations
    to properly resolve the endpoint by setting resolve method to "ip".
