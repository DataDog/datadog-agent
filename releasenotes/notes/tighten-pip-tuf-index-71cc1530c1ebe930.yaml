# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    If the user has not explicitly overrriden the pip indices, then we replace
    the PyPI index with our own by default, in order to prevent accidental
    installation of Datadog or even third-party packages from PyPI. The user
    may override this default behaviour using the `--idx-flags` option.
