# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    When installing / updating wheels using the ``datadog-agent integration``
    command, we replace the PyPI index with our own by default, in order to
    prevent accidental installation of Datadog or even third-party packages
    from PyPI.
  - |
    Remove some undocumented power user options to the ``datadog-agent
    integration`` command to prevent accidental misconfiguration that may
    reduce security guarantees.
