# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Optimized the Kubernetes State Metrics (KSM) check by replacing ``fmt.Sprintf()``
    calls with direct string concatenation in the ``ownerTags()`` function. This reduces
    memory allocation churn and saves approximately 20% CPU usage for the KSM check.
