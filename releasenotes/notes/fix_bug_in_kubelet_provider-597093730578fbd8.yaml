# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed bug in kubelet check when running in core agent that 
    was causing `kubernetes.kubelet.container.log_filesystem.used_bytes` 
    to be reported by the check for excluded/non-existing containers. 
    The metric was being reported in this case without tags. 
    This bug does not exist in the python integration version of the 
    kubelet check.
