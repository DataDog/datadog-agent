# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    In the agent.log, a DEBUG, WARN, and ERROR log are being added to report
    how many file handles the core agent process has open. The DEBUG log will
    report the info, the WARN log will appear when the Core Agent is over 90%
    of the OS file limit, and the ERROR log will appear when the Core Agent
    has reached 100% of the OS file limit. In the status.log, fields 
    CoreAgentProcessOpenFiles and OSFileLimit are being added to the Logs
    Agent section. This feature is currently for Linux only.
