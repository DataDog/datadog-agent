# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed a bug in the workloadmeta store. Subscribers that asked to receive
    only `unset` events mistakenly got `set` events on the first subscription for
    all the entities present in the store. This only affects the
    `container_lifecycle` check.
