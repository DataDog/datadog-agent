    Add a build option (`--glibc`) to build the Agent on `glibc` environment.
    On the other libc environments like `musl`, the Agent should be built without the option.
    The option enables system-probe gpu module and corechecks gpu collector using
    `github.com/NVIDIA/go-nvml` which depends on a glibc-extended definition.
