# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Introducing the port conflict suite to the Agent diagnose command. 
    Adding this for MacOS only first. Will incrementally add support for Linux and Windows. 
    The Agent might need particular permissions to read information about processes using ports.
