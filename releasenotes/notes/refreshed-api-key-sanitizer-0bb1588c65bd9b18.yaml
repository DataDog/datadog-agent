# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    If a metric transaction can't be sent to the endpoint, this transaction
    can be serialized to disk. When this occurs, the API key must be sanitized.
    This ensures that when an API key sourced from a secret is refreshed, the
    replacer continues to sanitize the new key.
