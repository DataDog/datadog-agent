# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    If a metric transaction can't be sent to the endpoint for whatever
    reason, this transaction can be serialized to disk. When this happens
    the API key needs to be sanitised. This ensures that when an API key
    that comes from a secret that is refreshed the replacer will continue
    to sanitise the new API key.
