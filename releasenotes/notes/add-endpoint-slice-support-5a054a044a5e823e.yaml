upgrade:
  - |
    Added support for EndpointSlices in the metadata controller. This feature,
    enabled by setting the environment variable `DD_KUBERNETES_ENDPOINT_SLICES`
    to `true`, resolves limitations of Endpoints resources, particularly for
    services with more than 1000 addresses.
fixes:
  - |
    Resolved a bug where `kube_service` tags were not properly deleted when a
    service's ties to pods on a specific node were removed but the service itself
    was not deleted.
