# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Added *experimental* support for Opentelemetry collecting via
    apm_config.otlp.http_port, apm_config.otlp.grpc_port or their corresponding
    environment variables (DD_APM_CONFIG_OTLP_{HTTP,GRPC}_PORT).
