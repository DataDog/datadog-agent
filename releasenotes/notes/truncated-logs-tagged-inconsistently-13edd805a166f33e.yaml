# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix bug wherein single line truncated logs ended with whitespace characters were not being tagged as truncated.
    Fix issue with the truncation message occasionally causing subsequent logs to think they were truncated when they were not (single line logs only).
