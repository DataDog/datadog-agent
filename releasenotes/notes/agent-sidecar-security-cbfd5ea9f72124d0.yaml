# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Datadog Cluster Agent admission controller agent sidecar injection now sets up
    Agent sidecars to run with securityContext of `readOnlyRootFilesystem:false` by default.
    Advanced users can customize the securityContext via clusterAgent.admissionController.agentSidecarInjection.profiles.
