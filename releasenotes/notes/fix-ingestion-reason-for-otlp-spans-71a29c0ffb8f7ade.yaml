# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix an issue where ``ingestion_reason:probabilistic`` is set
    even when an OTLP span was sampled by the Error Sampler.
    To enable the Error Sampler for OTLP spans, you need to set
    ``DD_OTLP_CONFIG_TRACES_PROBABILISTIC_SAMPLER_SAMPLING_PERCENTAGE``
    to 99 or lower, or enable ``DD_APM_PROBABILISTIC_SAMPLER_ENABLED``
    and set ``DD_APM_PROBABILISTIC_SAMPLER_PERCENTAGE`` to 99 or lower.
