upgrade:
  - |
    The Agent's forwarder now reads the proxy settings of the environment (``HTTP_PROXY``,
    ``HTTPS_PROXY`` and ``NO_PROXY``) unless proxy settings are configured in the Agent's
    configuration. This will affect your Agents if `proxy` is not specified in your
    Agent configuration.
fixes:
  - |
    Read proxy settings from the environment when none are set in the Agent's configuration.
