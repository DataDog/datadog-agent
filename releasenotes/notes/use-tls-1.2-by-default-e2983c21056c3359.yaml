enhancements:
  - |
    The ``min_tls_version`` configuration parameter is defined to `tlsv1.2` by
    default. Set its value to `tlsv1.0` or `tlsv1.1` if a lower version is needed.
   
deprecations:
  - |
    The deprecated ``force_tls_12`` configuration parameter is ignored even if
    ``min_tls_version`` is not given.
