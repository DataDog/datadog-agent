upgrade:
    The Agent now defaults to TLS 1.2 instead of TLS 1.0. The ``force_tls_12`` configuration parameter has been
    removed since it's now the default behavior.
    To continue using TLS 1.0 or 1.1, you must set the ``min_tls_version`` configuration parameter to either
    `tlsv1.0` or `tlsv1.1`.
