# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes a bug making the agent creating a lot of zombie (defunct) processes.
    This bug happened only with the docker images ``7.38.x`` when the containerized agent was launched without ``hostPID: true``.
