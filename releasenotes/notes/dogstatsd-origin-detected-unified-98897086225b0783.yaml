# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    dogstatsd: Implement new config option `origin_detection_unified`.
    This new option will allow users to configure the origin detection behavior for DogStatsD.
    When enabled, the DogStatsD server will use the default Origin Detection logic.
