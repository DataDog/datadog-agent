    The Windows Event Log tailer saves its current position in an event log and
    resumes reading from that location when the Agent restarts. This allows
    the Agent to collect events created before the Agent starts.
fixes:
  - |
    The Windows Event Log tailer automatically recovers and is able to resume collecting
    events when a log provider is reinstalled, which sometimes happens during Windows updates.
