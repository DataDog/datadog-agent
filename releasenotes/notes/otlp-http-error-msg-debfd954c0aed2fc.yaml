# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    OTLP spans describing an HTTP error without an explicit error message will now fallback
    to one with a description, eg. "500 Internal Server Error" instead of just "500".
    Users who relied on the error message to extract the status code should use `http.response.status_code` instead.
    
    Additionally, the error message is no longer sourced from the deprecated `http.status_text` attribute.
    This behavior can be overridden by explicitly setting the span's status message.
