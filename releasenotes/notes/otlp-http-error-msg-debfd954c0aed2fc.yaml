# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    OTLP spans describing an HTTP error now derive the `error.msg` attribute from the status code,
    instead of sourcing it from the deprecated `http.status_text` attribute.
    In other words, a span that previously had `error.msg: "500"` will now have `error.msg: "500 Internal Server Error"`.
    Users who relied on this attribute to extract the status code should use `http.response.status_code` instead,
    or can set `error.msg` manually to override this behavior.
