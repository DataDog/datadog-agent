    Logs Agent: Add ``logs.messages_discarded_context_cancelled`` telemetry metric
    to track messages discarded during file rotation when ``close_timeout`` expires.
    A warning is also logged when messages are discarded, helping users identify
    the need to increase ``DD_LOGS_CONFIG_CLOSE_TIMEOUT`` for slow pipelines.
