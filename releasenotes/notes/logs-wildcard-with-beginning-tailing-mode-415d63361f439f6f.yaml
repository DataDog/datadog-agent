    The logs agent now supports using ``start_position: beginning`` and
    ``start_position: forceBeginning`` with wildcard file paths. Previously,
    configurations like ``path: /var/log/*.log`` with ``start_position: beginning``
    would fail validation. The agent's fingerprinting system when enabled prevents 
    duplicate log reads during file rotation, making this combination safe to use.
