# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed a race condition in the logs auditor where ``Flush()`` could write a
    stale registry to disk during a transport restart. The auditor now drains
    all pending payloads from its input channel before flushing, ensuring file
    offsets are up to date and reducing duplicate log processing after a
    TCP-to-HTTP transport switch.
