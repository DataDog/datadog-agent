# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Precompiled eBPF for the network tracer system-probe module has been
    deprecated in favor of CO-RE and runtime compilation variants on Linux
    kernel versions 6+ and RHEL kernel versions 5.14+. To continue to use
    the precompiled eBPF network tracer, set
    `system_probe_config.allow_precompiled_fallback` in the
    system-probe config file, or set the environment variable
    `DD_ALLOW_PRECOMPILED_FALLBACK` to `true` on those platforms.
