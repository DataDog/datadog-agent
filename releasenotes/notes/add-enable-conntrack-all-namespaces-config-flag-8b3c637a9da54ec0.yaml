# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added new configuration flag,
    system_probe_config.enable_conntrack_all_namespaces,
    false by default. When set to true, this will allow system
    probe to monitor conntrack entries (for NAT info) in all
    namespaces that are peers of the root namespace.
