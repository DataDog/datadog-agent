# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    tcp_queue_length check: the previous metrics reported by this check (``tcp_queue.rqueue.size``, ``tcp_queue.rqueue.min``, ``tcp_queue.rqueue.max``, ``tcp_queue.wqueue.size``, ``tcp_queue.wqueue.min``, ``tcp_queue.wqueue.max``) were generating too much data because there was one time series generated per TCP connection.
    Those metrics have been replaced by ``tcp_queue.read_buffer_max_usage_pct``, ``tcp_queue.write_buffer_max_usage_pct`` which are aggregating all the connections of a container.
    These metrics are reporting the maximum usage in percent (amount of data divided by the queue capacity) of the busiest buffer.
    Additionally, `only_count_nb_context` option from the `tcp_queue_length` check configuration has been removed and will be ignored from now on.
