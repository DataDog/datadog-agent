enhancements:
  - |
    The `logs.dropped` metric now tracks dropped logs for both TCP and HTTP 
    log transports. Previously, this metric was only available when using TCP 
    transport. Customers can now monitor dropped logs with a single unified 
    metric regardless of which transport protocol is configured, making it 
    easier to detect and troubleshoot log delivery issues.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the ``logs.sent`` metric for the HTTP log transport to no longer 
    increment when logs are dropped due to non-retryable errors. This ensures 
    more accurate reporting of successfully delivered logs.
