# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add config option otlp_config.enabled to enable OTLP ingest.
fixes:
  - |
    Previously, an empty otlp_config.receiver section would incorrectly enable the OTLP ingest. After the fix, only explicitely set keys will trigger the OTLP ingest to be enabled.
