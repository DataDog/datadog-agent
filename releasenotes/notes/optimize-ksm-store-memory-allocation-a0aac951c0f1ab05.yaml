# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Optimize memory allocation in the KSM Core check by preallocating metric slices and skipping
    empty metrics in the store's Push() method. This should reduce 15% - 20% memory usage by ksm
    check, improving performance in clusters with large numbers of pods.
