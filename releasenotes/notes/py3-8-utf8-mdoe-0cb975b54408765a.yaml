# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

# must be readable independently of the other.

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Following the upgrade to Python 3.8, the Datadog Agent version ``>= 6.18.0``
    running Python 3 and version ``>= 7.18.0`` are now enforcing UTF8 encoding
    while running checks (and while running pdb debugger with `-b` option on the
    `check` cli command). Previous versions of the Agent were already using this
    encoding by default (depending on the environment variables) without enforcing it.
