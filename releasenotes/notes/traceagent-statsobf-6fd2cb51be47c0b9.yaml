# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Expose an "obfuscation_version" value via the /info endpoint. Accept a new header "Datadog-Obfuscation-Version" for incoming stats payloads; if any non-zero value is set, the trace-agent will not attempt to obfuscate these payloads as they have already been obfuscated by the tracer.
