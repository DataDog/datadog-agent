# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The trace-agent running in the Azure App Services Extension now adds
    function tags to the tracer payloads that it sends to Datadog. This allows
    the traces to be queried by the trace tags, which is particularly useful
    for standard filtering in the Datadog UI.
