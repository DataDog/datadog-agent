    To match the behavior of Agent 5, a flag has been introduced to make the
    agent use ``hostname -f`` on unix-based systems before trying ``os.Hostname()``.
    This flag is turned off by default for 6.3 and will be enabled by default in 6.4.
    The import command used to upgrade from the Agent5 to the Agent6 will enable
    this flag in the config.
