# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    CWS uses `**` for subfolder matching instead of `*`.
    Previously, `*` was used to match files and subfolders. With this
    release, `*` will match only files and folders at the same level. Use`**`
    at the end of a path to match files and subfolders. `**` must be
    used at the end of the path. For example, the rule `open.file.path == "/etc/*"`
    has to be converted to `open.file.path == "/etc/**"`.
