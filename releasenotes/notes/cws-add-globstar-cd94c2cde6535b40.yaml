# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    CWS makes use of `**` pattern for subfolder matching instead of `*`.
    Before `*` could be used in order to match files and subfolders. With this
    release `*` will match only files and folders and the same level. `**` can
    be used at the end of a path in order to match files and subfolders. `**` is
    only supported at the end of a path. In order to keep the same behaviors the
    rules like `open.file.path == "/etc/*"` as to be converted to
    `open.file.path == "/etc/**"`.
