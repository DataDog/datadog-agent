# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add a new host tag called ``orch_cluster_id`` that is set to the
    Kubernetes cluster ID generated by the cluster-agent. This is added only
    for the hosts that are part of a Kubernetes cluster.
    This tag is also used on every cluster-level resources like
    `kubernetes_state.*` metrics, kubernetes events, and orchestrator level
    resources.
