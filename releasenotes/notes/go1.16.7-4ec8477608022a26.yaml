# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Agents are now built with Go1.16.  This will have one user-visible change:
    on Linux, the process-level RSS metric for agent processes will be
    reduced from earlier versions.  This reflects a change in how memory
    usage is calculated, not a reduction in used memory, and is an artifact
    of the Go runtime `switching from MADV_FREE to MADV_DONTNEED
    <https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#runtime>`_.
