# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added new config option ``include_ephemeral_containers`` to collect
    Kubernetes ephemeral containers. The option is disabled by default. When
    enabled, the Agent will report ``container.*`` and ``kubernetes.*`` metrics
    for ephemeral containers. It will also collect logs and schedule checks for
    ephemeral containers when configured to do so.
