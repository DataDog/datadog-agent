# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add ``dogstatsd_pipeline_autoadjust_strategy`` setting with ``max_throughput`` and ``per_origin``
    strategies. ``max_throughput`` is the already existing strategy (when ``dogstatsd_pipeline_autoadjust``
    is ``true``). ``per_origin`` will let you create an arbitrary number of pipelines (based on ``dogstatsd_pipeline_count``),
    and will try to isolate containers based on their advertised origin. This will improve compression.
