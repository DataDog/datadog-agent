# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    A new configuration option has been added to `observability_pipelines_worker.logs`
    called `dualship`. When this is set to `true`, the agent will ship 
    logs both to the Observability Pipelines Worker and to the main
    endpoint.
