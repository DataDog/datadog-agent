# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The integrations freeze cli command now relies on pip list under the
    hood, this has been prompted by the implementation of PEP610 in more
    recent pip versions (>20.1). Thus, pip freeze is no longer appropriate
    for version listing.
    The change has resulted in a new format for the integration versions
    listing. If customers relied on the `datadog-agent integration freeze`
    command for automation or processing, this change could affect them.
