# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed a bug in the Docker check that affects the
    `docker.containers.running` metric. It was reporting wrong values in cases
    where multiple containers with different `env`, `service`, `version`, etc.
    tags were using the same image.
