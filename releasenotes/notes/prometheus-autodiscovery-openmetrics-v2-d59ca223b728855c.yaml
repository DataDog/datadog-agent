# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Make the Prometheus auto-discovery be able to schedule OpenMetrics V2 checks instead of legacy V1 ones.

    By default, the Prometheus annotations based auto-discovery will keep on scheduling openmetrics v1 check.
    But the agent now has a `prometheus_scrape.version` parameter that can be set to ``2`` to schedule the v2.

    The changes between the two versions of the check are described in
    https://datadoghq.dev/integrations-core/legacy/prometheus/#config-changes-between-versions
