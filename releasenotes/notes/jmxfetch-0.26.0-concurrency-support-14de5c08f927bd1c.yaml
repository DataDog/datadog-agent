# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    JMXFetch upgraded to 0.26.1: introduces concurrent metric collection across
    JMXFetch check instances. Concurrent collection should avoid stalling
    healthy instances in the event of issues (networking, system) in
    any of the remaining instances configured. A timeout of ``jmx_collection_timeout``
    (default 60s) is enforced on the whole metric collection run.
    See `0.25.0  <https://github.com/DataDog/jmxfetch/releases/tag/0.25.0>`_,
    `0.26.0  <https://github.com/DataDog/jmxfetch/releases/tag/0.26.0>`_ and
    `0.26.1  <https://github.com/DataDog/jmxfetch/releases/tag/0.26.1>`_.
