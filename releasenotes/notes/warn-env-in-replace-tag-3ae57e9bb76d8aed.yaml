# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    An error will now be logged if replace tags are used to change the Agent
    "env", since this could have negative side effects. At this time, an error
    is logged, but future versions may explicitly disallow this to avoid bugs.
    See https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tracing/#environment-name
    for instructions on setting the env, and
    https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/issues/21253 for more details
    about this issue.
