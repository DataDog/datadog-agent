# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add support for separate CPU/Memory requests and limits for auto-instrumentation init containers.
    New environment variables allow independent configuration of requests and limits:
    
    * ``DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INIT_REQUESTS_CPU``
    * ``DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INIT_REQUESTS_MEMORY``
    * ``DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INIT_LIMITS_CPU``
    * ``DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INIT_LIMITS_MEMORY``
    
    This resolves OOMKilled issues while maintaining scheduling efficiency by allowing
    low requests for scheduling and higher limits for initialization spikes.
    Existing ``DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INIT_RESOURCES_*`` 
    environment variables continue to work for backward compatibility.
