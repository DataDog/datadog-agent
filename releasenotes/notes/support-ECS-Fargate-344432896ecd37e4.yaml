features:
  - |
    Add a service listener for ECS Fargate, and a config provider. Also add
    the concept of ECSContainer and make it compatible with Docker containers
    so that the process agent can handle them.
issues:
  - |
    Having a separate type of container for ECS is not ideal, we will need to
    change how we represent containers to make it more generic. We also need
    to improve hostname handling, this will come in a follow up PR.
