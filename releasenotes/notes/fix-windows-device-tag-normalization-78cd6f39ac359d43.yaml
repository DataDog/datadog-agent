    The new version of the disk check on Windows now normalizes the ``device:`` tag by stripping
    backslashes and lowercasing, matching the Python disk check behavior.
    This ensures customers that migrated from Python to Go disk check see
    consistent ``device:`` tag values (e.g., ``C:\`` becomes ``c:``).
