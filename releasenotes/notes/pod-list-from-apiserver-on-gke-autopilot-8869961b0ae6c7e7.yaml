    Added support for querying the pod list through the API server. This feature, enabled by setting `kubeletUseApiServer`
    to `true`, allows the Agent to retrieve pod metadata directly from the API server instead of the kubelet. 
    This resolves issues when direct access to the kubelet `/pods` endpoint is restricted. 
    The agent will continue to query the kubelet for `/metrics` and `/stats/summary`.
    Must add `pods` to Agent cluster role.
