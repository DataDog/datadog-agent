# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added macOS support for the Software Inventory feature in System Probe.
    The agent now collects installed software from multiple sources on macOS:
    applications (``/Applications/`` and per-user ``~/Applications/``),
    Mac App Store installations, PKG installer receipts, Homebrew formulae
    and casks, MacPorts packages, Nix packages, Conda/Mamba environments,
    Python pip packages, Node.js npm global packages, Ruby gems, Rust cargo
    crates, kernel extensions, and system extensions. The collected data
    includes software name, version, install date, publisher, and installation
    path. Broken installations are detected and flagged with a reason.
