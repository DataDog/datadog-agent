# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

deprecations:
  - |
    Changed the attribute name to define the host IPs for the process agent
    docker container from `process_agent_config.host_ips` to
    `process_config.docker_host_ips`. `process_agent_config.host_ips` is
    still supported.
fixes:
  - |
    The process agent no longer logs a cast warning message when no
    host IPs have been configured.
