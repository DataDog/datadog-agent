# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    APM: the writer will now flush based on an estimated number of bytes
    in accumulated buffer size, as opposed to a maximum number of spans,
    resulting in better traffic and payload size management.
deprecations:
  - |
    APM: the yaml setting `apm_config.trace_writer.max_spans_per_payload`
    is no longer in use; writes are now based solely on accumulated byte
    size.
