# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added the ``enable_otlp_container_tags_v2`` feature flag,
    which may reduce the Agent's outgoing traffic when ingesting OTLP traces from containerized applications.
    
    However, the flag introduces some breaking changes:
    - container tags on the new spans can no longer be queried as span attributes (with ``@``);
    - using the ``k8s.pod.uid`` attribute as a fallback container ID is no longer supported;
    - disabling the infraattributes processor in DDOT trace pipelines will prevent automatic container tag detection.
