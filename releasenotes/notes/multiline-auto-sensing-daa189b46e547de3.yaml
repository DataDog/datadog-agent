# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add multi-line auto-sensing when tailing logs from file.
    It checks the 1000 first lines (or waits 30 seconds, whichever is first)
    when tailing for a list of known timestamp formats. If the 
    number of matched lines is greater than the threshold it 
    switches to the MultiLineHandler with the pattern matching
    the timestamp format. The pattern chosen is saved in the log
    config and is reused if the file rotates.  Use the new global config 
    parameter: ``logs_config.auto_multi_line_detection`` to enable
    the feature.  New per log integration config parameters:
    * ``auto_multi_line_detection`` to enable the feature on a case
      by case basis
