# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add multi-line auto-sensing when tailing logs from file.
    It checks for the 1000 first lines (or waits 30 seconds)
    when tailing for a know list of timestamp format. If the 
    number of matched lines is greater than the threshold it 
    switches to the MultiLineHandler with the regexp matching
    the timestamp format. The regex chosen is saved in the log
    config and is reused if the file rotates.  New global config 
    parameter: ``logs_config.auto_multi_line_detection`` to enable
    the feature.  New per log integration config parameters:
    * ``auto_multi_line_detection`` to enable the feature on a case
      by case basis
