# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: The Agent now supports obfuscation of the Memcached command key by
    default. This can be disabled with `DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_MEMCACHED_REMOVE_KEY`
    or `apm_config.obfuscation.memcached.remove_key` in the datadog.yaml.
