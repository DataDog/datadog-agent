    Windows: Fixed a Process Agent issue where process metadata (for example executable
    path, command line, and username) could be incorrectly reused after Windows PID
    recycling. The agent now validates process identity with PID + creation time in
    both Toolhelp and performance-counter probes, and refreshes cached metadata when
    a PID is reused.
