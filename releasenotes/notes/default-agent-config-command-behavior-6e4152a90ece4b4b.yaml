# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The ``agent config`` command now displays only user-configured settings by default,
    excluding default values. Use ``agent config --all`` to display
    all settings including defaults (previous behavior).
