# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: New configuration apm_config.obfuscation.credit_cards.skip_keys (DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_CREDIT_CARDS_SKIP_KEYS)
    can be used to skip specific tag keys that are known to never contain credit card numbers. This is especially useful
    in cases where a span tag value is a number that triggers false positives from the credit card obfuscator.
