# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed ECS ARN parsing to support AWS GovCloud (``aws-us-gov``) and China (``aws-cn``) regions.
    Previously, only the standard ``aws`` partition was accepted, causing ECS metadata extraction
    to fail for customers running the Datadog Agent in GovCloud or China regions. This resulted
    in empty region and account ID values, breaking ECS monitoring for these customers.
