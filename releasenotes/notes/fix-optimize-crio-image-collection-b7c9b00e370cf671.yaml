# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Store previously seen images in workloadmeta, and only query the image 
    status endpoint for new images. Previously, if image collection for CRI-O 
    was enabled, the Agent would query the image status endpoint for every 
    image, on every check. This was an expensive network request and would 
    log verbose output to journald.
