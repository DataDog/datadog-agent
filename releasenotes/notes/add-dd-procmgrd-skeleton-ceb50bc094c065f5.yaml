    Add ``dd-procmgrd``, a minimal Rust daemon skeleton for the upcoming
    Datadog process manager. This initial version only starts, logs, and
    waits for a shutdown signal. The full build, packaging, and systemd
    service installation pipeline is wired up but the daemon has no
    functional behavior yet.
