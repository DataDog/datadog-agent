# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The agent was collecting docker container logs (metrics)
    even if they are matching `DD_CONTAINER_EXCLUDE_LOGS`
    (resp. `DD_CONTAINER_EXCLUDE_METRICS`)
    if they were started before the agent. This is now fixed.
