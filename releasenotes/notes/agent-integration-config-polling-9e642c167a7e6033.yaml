# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Optionally poll Agent integration configuration files for changes after startup. This allows the Agent to pick up new
    integration configuration without a restart. This is enabled/disabled with the `autoconf_config_files_poll` boolean
    configuration variable, and the polling interval is configured with the `autoconf_config_files_poll_interval`.
    Warning- The ConfigFilesReader implementation will cache the files in memory regardless of any changes.
