    Optionally poll Agent and Cluster Agent integration configuration files for changes after startup. This allows the Agent/Cluster Agent to pick up new
    integration configuration without a restart.
    This is enabled/disabled with the `autoconf_config_files_poll` boolean configuration variable.
    The polling interval is configured with the `autoconf_config_files_poll_interval` (default 60s).
    Note: Dynamic removal of logs configuration is currently not supported.
