# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Cluster check tagging has been unified across all different environments.
    Now, DD_TAGS, DD_EXTRA_TAGS, DD_CLUSTER_CHECKS_EXTRA_TAGS, and DD_ORCHESTRATOR_EXPLORER_EXTRA_TAGS
    will apply to all cluster check data, including when executing on the Cluster Agent itself, or when
    dispatched to execute on the Node Agent or Cluster Checks Runner.
