# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Private Action Runner now supports storing identity credentials in Kubernetes secrets
    for cluster agent deployments. This enables multi-replica cluster agent setups to share
    a single PAR identity across all replicas. Configure with
    ``private_action_runner.identity_use_k8s_secret: true`` to enable Kubernetes secret
    storage. The feature is backward compatible and defaults to file-based storage.
