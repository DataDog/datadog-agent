# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix memory leaks in the cluster checks agent: a context leak in the
    heartbeat sender where ``defer cancel()`` inside a loop accumulated
    unreleased contexts, an unbounded growth of check run error entries
    that were never cleaned up, and a ticker goroutine leak in the
    check scheduler job queue.
