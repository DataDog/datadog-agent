# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Transparent Huge Pages (THP) usage is now disabled by default
    in the System Probe and Security Agent. To re-enable their usage,
    set the `system_probe_config.disable_thp` or `security_agent.disable_thp`
    configuration options to `false`.
