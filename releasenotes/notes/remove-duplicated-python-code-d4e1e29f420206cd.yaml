    The core Agent check Python code is no longer duplicated here and is instead
    pulled from integrations-core. The code now resides in the `datadog_checks`
    namespace, though the old `checks`, `utils`, etc. paths are still supported.
    Please update your custom checks accordingly. For more information, see
    https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/docs/agent/changes.md#python-modules
