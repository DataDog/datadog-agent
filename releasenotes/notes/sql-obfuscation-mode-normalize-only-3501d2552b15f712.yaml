# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    dbm: add new SQL obfuscation mode ``normalize_only`` to support normalizing SQL without obfuscating it. 
    This mode is useful for customers who want to view unobfuscated SQL statements.
    By default, ``ObfuscationMode`` is set to ``obfuscate_and_normalize`` and every SQL statement is obfuscated and normalized.
