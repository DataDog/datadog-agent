# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes an issue where usage of the extra_dbname variable in the Aurora
    Discovery template would be an empty string if the database name
    was not specified in the database cluster resource, instead preferring to fallback
    to the default database name for the engine.
