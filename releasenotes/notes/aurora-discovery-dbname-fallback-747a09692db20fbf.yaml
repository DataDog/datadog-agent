# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes an issue where the `extra_dbname` variable in the Aurora
    Discovery template would default to an empty string if no database name
    was specified in the cluster resource. It now correctly falls back to the engine's default database name.
