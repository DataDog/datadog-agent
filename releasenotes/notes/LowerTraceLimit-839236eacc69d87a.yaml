# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Lower default incoming trace payload limit to 25MB. This more closely aligns with the backend limit. Some users may see traces rejected by the Agent that the Agent would have previously accepted, but would have subsequently been rejected by the trace intake. The Agent limit can still be configured via `apm_config.max_payload_size`.
