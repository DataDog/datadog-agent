    The Agent can now be configured to restrict which secrets from Kubernetes can be by integration (only apply to
    secret using the `k8s_secret@` prefix).

    Three new settings have been introduced, allowing different levels of control (see datadog.yaml.example for more
    information).

    * `secret_scope_integration_to_their_k8s_namespace`: limit containers to their own namespace.
    * `secret_allowed_k8s_namespace`: limit containers to a set of predefined namespaces.
    * `secret_image_to_handle`: explicitly list which secret can be accessed by which container image.
