    Process Agent now runs by default even outside of a container. When running, the process agent does not collect full
    statistics on proceses. Instead, the process agent only gathers metadata on processes, and uses this data to suggest
    possible integrations that the user may enable. This check is lightweight, and is configured by default to only run every 4 hours.

    Created a new process discovery check. This is a lightweight check that runs every 4 hours by default, and collects
    process metadata, so that Datadog can suggest potential integrations for the user to enable.
