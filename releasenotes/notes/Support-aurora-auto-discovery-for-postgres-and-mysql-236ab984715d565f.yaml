# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Support database-monitoring autodiscovery for Aurora cluster instances. Adds a new configuration listener to poll
    for a specific set of Aurora cluster IDs and then create a new database-monitoring supported check
    configuration for each endpoint. This allows for monitoring of endpoints that scale dynamically.
