    The Agent can send its own configuration to Datadog to be displayed in the `Agent Configuration` section of the host
    detail panel. See https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/list/#agent-configuration for more information. The
    Agent configuration is scrubbed of any sensitive information and only contains configuration youâ€™ve set using the
    configuration file or environment variables.
