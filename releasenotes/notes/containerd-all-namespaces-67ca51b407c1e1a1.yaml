# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added possibility to watch all the namespaces when running on containerd
    outside Kubernetes. By default, the agent will report events and metrics
    from all the namespaces. In order to select a specific one, please set the
    `containerd_namespace` option.
