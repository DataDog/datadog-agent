    A change in the 'set_external_tags' function from the 'datadog_agent' Python
    module might affect custom checks that use it by silently dropping single tags
    defined with the 'unicode' type. Before upgrading, custom checks that call the
    function directly like  'datadog_agent.set_external_tags(...)', should be
    changed to call the method with the same signature from the base class, like
    'self.set_external_tags(...)'.
