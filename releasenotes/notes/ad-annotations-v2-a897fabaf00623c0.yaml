    The Agent now supports a single "ad.datadoghq.com/$IDENTIFIER.checks"
    annotation in Kubernetes Pods and Services to configure Autodiscovery
    checks. It merges the contents of the existing "check_names",
    "init_configs" (now optional), and "instances" annotations into a single
    JSON value.
