# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Moving the Orchestrator Explorer pod check from the process agent to the core agent. In the following release we will be removing the process agent check and defaulting to the core agent check. If you want to migrate ahead of time you can set ``orchestrator_explorer.run_on_node_agent`` = true in your configuration.
