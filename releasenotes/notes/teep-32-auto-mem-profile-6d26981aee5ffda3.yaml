    A new core check, agentprofiling, has been introduced to automatically generate a flare 
    with profiles when the Datadog Agent exceeds a configured memory or CPU usage threshold. 
    When a valid config file is set, the Agent monitors its own memory and CPU usage and, 
    upon crossing the threshold, generates a flare with profiles that is either saved locally or 
    sent to a Zendesk ticket. 
    
    This enhancement simplifies troubleshooting memory-related issues that are difficult to 
    reproduce or time, allowing users to passively capture critical memory data without manual 
    intervention.

    In rare cases, profiles generated by the Agent (including those triggered by the new 
    agentprofiling check) may become corrupted. This is a known limitation of the underlying
    profile generation system and is not specific to this feature. Corrupted profiles are unusable for analysis. If profiles are still needed, Datadog recommends restarting the Agent and contacting Datadog support for assistance.
