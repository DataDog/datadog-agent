    A new core check, agentprofiling, has been introduced to automatically generate a flare 
    with profiles when the Datadog Agent exceeds a configured memory or CPU usage threshold. 
    When a valid config file is set, the Agent will monitor its own memory and CPU usage and, 
    upon crossing the threshold, generate a flare with profiles is either generated locally or 
    sent to a Zendesk ticket. 
    
    This enhancement simplifies troubleshooting memory-related issues that are difficult to 
    reproduce or time, allowing users to passively capture critical memory data without manual 
    intervention.

    In rare cases, profiles generated by the Agent (including those triggered by the new 
    agentprofiling check) may become corrupted. This is a known limitation of the underlying
    profile generation system and is not specific to this feature. If a corrupted profile is 
    encountered, it will be unusable for analysis. We recommend restarting the Agent if profiles 
    are still needed and contacting Datadog support for assistance.
