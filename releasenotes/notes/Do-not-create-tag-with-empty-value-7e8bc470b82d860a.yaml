# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Most checks are stripping tags with an empty value. KSM was missing this logic so that KSM specific metrics could have a tag with an empty value.
    They will now be stripped like for any other check.
