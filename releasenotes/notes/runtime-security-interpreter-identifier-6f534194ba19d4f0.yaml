# Each section from every release note are combined when theÂª
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Adds ability to identify the interpreter of a script inside a script via the shebang. Example rule would be `exec.interpreter.file.name == ~"python*"`. This feature is currently limited to one layer of nested script. For example, a python script in a shell script will be caught, but a perl script inside a python script inside a shell script will not be caught.
