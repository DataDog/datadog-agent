# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: In order to improve the default customer experience regarding
    sensitive data, the Agent now obfuscates database statements within
    span metadata by default. This includes MongoDB queries,
    ElasticSearch request bodies, and raw commands from Redis and
    MemCached. Previously, this setting was off by default.
    This update could have performance implications, or obfuscate data that
    is not sensitive, and can be disabled or configured through the
    `obfuscation` options within the `apm_config`, or with the
    environment variables prefixed with `DD_APM_OBFUSCATION`. Please read the
    [Data Security documentation for full details](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/configure_data_security/#trace-obfuscation).
