# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    The log agent now uses zstd compression as default for improved performance and reduced bandwidth usage.
    By default, zstd compression is used when no additional endpoints are configured.
  - |
    Improved logging compression settings across different agent pipelines. Debug logs now clearly indicate whether compression settings are coming from pipeline-specific configuration, global logs configuration, or default fallback settings. This helps debug compression behavior across different pipelines.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed potential compatibility issues with non-Datadog intakes by ensuring gzip compression is used
    when additional endpoints are configured.
  - |
    Fixed event platform forwarder to use correct pipeline-specific compression settings instead of log endpoint settings.
    All non-log pipelines now default to zstd compression unless configured otherwise.
other:
  - |
    The compression behavior is now also determined by the presence of additional endpoints:
    - When additional endpoints are configured: gzip compression is used
    - When no additional endpoints are configured: the default zstd compression is used
