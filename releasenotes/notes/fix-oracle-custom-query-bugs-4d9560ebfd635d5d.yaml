# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

  - |
    Oracle check: Remove redundant ``GetSender`` call in custom query
    handling in favor of the existing ``commit`` helper.
