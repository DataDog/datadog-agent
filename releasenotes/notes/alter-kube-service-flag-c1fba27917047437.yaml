# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Adds a `kubernetes_kube_service_new_behavior` flag (default false) to alter `kube_service` tag behavior.
    If the flag is set to true, `kube_service` tag is attached unconditionally.
    Previously, the tag was only attached when the Kubernetes service has the status `Ready`.
