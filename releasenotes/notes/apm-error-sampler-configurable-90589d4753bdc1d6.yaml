# Each section from every release note is combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: The error sampler TPS can be configured using the environment variable DD_APM_ERROR_TPS
    or the `apm_config.error_traces_per_second` configuration. It defaults to 10 extra trace chunks sampled 
    per second on top of the base head sampling.
    The TPS is spread to catch all combinations of service, name, resource, http.status, and error.type.

    APM: The `apm_config.max_traces_per_second` setting no longer affects error sampling.
    To change the TPS for errors, use `apm_config.error_traces_per_second` instead.
