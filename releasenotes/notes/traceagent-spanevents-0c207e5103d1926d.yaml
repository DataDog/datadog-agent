# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:

    APM: Adds span events as a top level payload field. Span events received this way will be altered according to rules defined by DD_APM_REPLACE_TAGS. Credit card obfuscation will also be applied to span event attributes.
  - |
    APM: If apm_config.obfuscation.remove_stack_traces is enabled the trace agent will now also remove the value at span tag `exception.stacktrace` replacing it with a "?".
