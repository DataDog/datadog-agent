# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Breaking change - In the version 6.11.2 logic was added in the Agent to first look for K8s container files if `/var/log/pods` was not available and then to go for the Docker socket.
    This created some permission issues as `/var/log/pods` can be a symlink in some configuration and the Agent also needed access to the symlink directory.

    This logic is reverted to its prior behaviour which prioritise the Docker socket for container log collection.
    It is still possible to force the agent to go for the K8s log files even if the Docker socket is mounted by using the `logs_config.k8s_container_use_file' or `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_K8S_CONTAINER_USE_FILE`. parameter.
    This is recommended when more than 10 containers are running on the same pod.
