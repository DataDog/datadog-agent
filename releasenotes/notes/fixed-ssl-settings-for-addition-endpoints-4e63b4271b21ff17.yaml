# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed Logs Agent additional endpoints to respect their
    logs_no_ssl setting.
other:
  - |
    Added a warning when ``logs_no_ssl`` is set and ``dd_url``
    contains an https prefix. ``logs_no_ssl`` will take precedence
    over the prefix in a future version.
