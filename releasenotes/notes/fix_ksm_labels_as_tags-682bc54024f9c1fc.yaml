# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    In ``kubernetes_state_core`` check, fix the `labels_as_tags` feature when the same Kubernetes label must be turned into different Datadog tags, depending on the resource:

       labels_as_tags:
         daemonset:
           first_owner: kube_daemonset_label_first_owner
         deployment:
           first_owner: kube_deployment_label_first_owner
