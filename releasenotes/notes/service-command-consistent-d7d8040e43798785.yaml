# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The ``agent`` CLI subcommands related to Windows services are now
    consistent in use of dashes in the command names (``install-service``,
    ``start-service``, and so on). The names without dashes are supported as
    aliases.
