# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The logs agent now retries log payloads on HTTP 403 (Forbidden) responses
    instead of dropping them, when the secrets component is available. This applies to the core logs agent,
    CWS security reporter, compliance reporter, and the event platform forwarder. Callers without the secrets
    component (serverless, OTel) retain the original drop behavior.
