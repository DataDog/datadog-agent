# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The logs agent now retries log payloads on HTTP 403 (Forbidden) responses
    instead of dropping them, when the endpoint's API key was resolved from a
    secrets backend. On 403, the agent triggers an asynchronous secrets refresh
    and retries the payload. This applies to the core logs agent, CWS security
    reporter, compliance reporter, and the event platform forwarder. Endpoints
    whose API key is not managed by the secrets backend retain the original
    drop behavior.
