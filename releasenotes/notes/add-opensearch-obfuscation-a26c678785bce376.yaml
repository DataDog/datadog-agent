# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Add obfuscation support for OpenSearch statements within span metadata. This feature works in the same way as the existing Elasticsearch one, and is enabled by default. It is configured by binding ``apm_config.obfuscation.opensearch.*`` parameters to new obfuscation environment variables. In particular, bind:
    ``apm_config.obfuscation.opensearch.enabled`` to ``DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_OPENSEARCH_ENABLED``:
    It accepts a boolean value with default value true.

    ``apm_config.obfuscation.opensearch.keep_values`` to ``DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_OPENSEARCH_KEEP_VALUES``
    It accepts a list of strings of the form ``["id1", "id2"]``.

    ``apm_config.obfuscation.opensearch.obfuscate_sql_values`` to ``DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_OPENSEARCH_OBFUSCATE_SQL_VALUES``
    It accepts a list of strings of the form ``["key1", "key2"]``.
