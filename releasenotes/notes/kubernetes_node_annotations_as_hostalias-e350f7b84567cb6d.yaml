# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add the ``kubernetes_node_annotations_as_host_aliases`` parameter to specify a list
    of Kubernetes node annotations that should be used as host aliases.
    If not set, it defaults to ``cluster.k8s.io/machine``.
