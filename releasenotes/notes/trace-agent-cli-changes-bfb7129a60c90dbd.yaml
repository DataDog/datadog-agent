# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The command line arguments to the Datadog Agent Trace Agent ``trace-agent``
    have changed from single-dash arguments to double-dash arguments.
    For example, ``-config`` must now be provided as ``--config``.
    Additionally, subcommands have been added, these may be listed with the
    ``--help`` switch. For backward-compatibility reasons the old CLI arguments
    will still work in the foreseeable future but may be removed in future versions.

    Please note that significant changes have been introduced to the Datadog Trace
    Agent for this release. Though these changes should not alter user-facing agent
