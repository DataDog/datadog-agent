# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: DogStatsD data can now be proxied through the "/dogstatsd/v1/proxy" endpoint
    over UDS or UDP. If a socket is provided with dogstatsd_socket, the proxy will
    default to proxying over UDS. Otherwise, UDP will be used. See
    https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd#setup for configuration details.
