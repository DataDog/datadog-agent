    Fix incorrect use of a namespaced PID with the host procfs when parsing mountinfo to ensure debugfs is mounted correctly.
    This issue was preventing system-probe startup in AWS ECS. This issue could also surface in other containerized environments
    where PID namespaces are in use and ``/host/proc`` is mounted.
