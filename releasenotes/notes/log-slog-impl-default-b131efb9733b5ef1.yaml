# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Agent's logger has been rewritten with a more modern library to improve
    security and performance. No visible change is expected for users.
    In case of issues, the previous logger can still be used by setting
    `log_use_slog` to `false` in the Agent configuration. This configuration will
    be removed in a future release.
