# Each section from every release note is combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. Therefore, the text should be worded in a way
# that does not depend on any information available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.
