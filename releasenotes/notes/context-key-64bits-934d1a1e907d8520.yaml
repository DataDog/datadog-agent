# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Improved performances in metric aggregation logic.
    Use 64 bits context keys instead of 128 bits in order to benefit from better
    performances using them as map keys (fast path methods) + better performances
    while computing the hash thanks to inlining.
