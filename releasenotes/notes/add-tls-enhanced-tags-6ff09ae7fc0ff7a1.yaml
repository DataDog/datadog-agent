# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Agent will now tag TLS enhanced metrics like `tls_version` and `tls_cipher`.
    This will allow you to filter and aggregate metrics based on the TLS version and cipher used in the connection.
    The tags will be added in CNM and USM.
