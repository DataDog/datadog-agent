    The EventIDs logged to the Windows Application Event Log by the Agent services
    have been normalized and now have the same meaning across Agent services.
    Some EventIDs have changed and the rendered message may be incorrect
    if you view an Event Log from a host that uses a different version of the Agent
    than the host that created the Event Log. To ensure you see the correct message,
    choose "Display information for these languages" when exporting the Event
    Log from the host. This does not affect Event Logs collected by the Datadog Agent's
    Windows Event Log integration, which renders the event messages on the originating host.
    The EventIDs and messages used by the Agent services can be viewed in
    ``pkg/util/winutil/messagestrings/messagestrings.mc``.
