# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Private Action Runner (PAR) now runs in the Datadog Cluster Agent with
    improved identity management for Kubernetes environments. PAR identity (URN
    and private key) is now stored in a Kubernetes secret and shared across all
    DCA replicas using leader election. The leader replica handles enrollment and
    secret creation, while follower replicas wait for and read the shared identity.
    This enables multiple DCA replicas to execute PAR tasks using a single cluster
    identity, eliminating the need for per-replica enrollment.
