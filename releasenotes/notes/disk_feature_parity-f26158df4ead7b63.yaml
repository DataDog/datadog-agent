# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Feature parity between Python disk check and Go disk check.
    The new version of the disk check is disabled by default for now, but it will be enabled later on.
    It can be enabled by setting ``use_diskv2_check: true`` in your configuration.
