    The metadata payload containing the status of every integration run by the Agent is now sent one minute after startup
    and then every ten minutes after that, as before. This means that the integration status will be visible in the app one
    minute after the Agent starts instead of ten minutes. The payload waits for a minute so the Agent has time to run every configured
    integration twice and collect an accurate status.
