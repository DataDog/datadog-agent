# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    In OTLP metrics ingestion, the `instrumentation_scope_metadata_as_tags` option is now enabled by default. This means scope attributes are now added as tags to metrics.
    If you have too many unique values for instrumentation scope attributes, this may cause cardinality issues.
    To mitigate this, you can disable the behavior by setting `datadog.metrics.instrumentation_scope_metadata_as_tags` to `false`.
