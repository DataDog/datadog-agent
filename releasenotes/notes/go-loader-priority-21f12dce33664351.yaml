# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    If a check has both a Go and a Python version, the Go version now has priority by default.
    It should not have any visible impact for users, but if needed it can be
    disabled by setting `prioritize_go_check_loader` configuration to `false`.
