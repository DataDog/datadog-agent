# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The introduction of multiple runners for checks implies check
    instances may now run concurrently. This will affect checks which
    are not thread-safe as they may, depending on the scheduling, access
    unsynchronized structures concurrently with the corresponding data
    race ensuing. Please be cautious. If you wish to run checks in a fully
    sequential fashion, you may set the `check_runners` option in your
    `datadog.yaml` config or via the `DD_CHECK_RUNNERS` to 1. Also, please
    feel free to reach out to us if you need more information or help
    with the new multiple runner/concurrency model.

    Bump the default number of check runners to 4. This has some
    concurrency implications as we will now run multiple checks in
    parallel.
