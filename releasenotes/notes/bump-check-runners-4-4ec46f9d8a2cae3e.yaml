    The introduction of multiple runners for checks implies check
    instances may now run concurrently. This should help the agent
    make better use of resources, in particular it will help prevent
    or reduce the side-effects of slow checks delaying the execution
    of all other checks.

    The change will affect custom checks not enforcing thread safety as
    they may, depending on the schedule, access unsynchronized structures
    concurrently with the corresponding data race ensuing. If you wish to
    run checks in a fully sequential fashion, you may set the `check_runners`
    option in your `datadog.yaml` config or via the `DD_CHECK_RUNNERS` to 1.
    Also, please feel free to reach out to us if you need more information
    or help with the new multiple runner/concurrency model.

    For more details please read the technical note in the `datadog.yaml`_.

    Bump the default number of check runners to 4. This has some
    concurrency implications as we will now run multiple checks in
    parallel.
