# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    instances may now run concurrently. This will affect checks which
    are not thread-safe as they may, depending on the scheduling, access
    unsynchronized structures concurrently with the corresponding data
    race ensuing. Please be cautious and feel free to reach out to us
    if you wish to change the number of runners.

    Bump the default number of check runners to 4. This has some
    concurrency implications as we will now run multiple checks in
    parallel.
