# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add support for ``image_pull_duration_seconds`` metric from Kubernetes 1.30+.
    This histogram metric tracks container image pull latency and is now collected
    as ``kubelet.image.pull_duration`` in the kubelet integration.
