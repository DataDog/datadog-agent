# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes an issue in the Agent where it could potentially try to make a new file tailer
    for a cronjob pod container that has already completed and has already been processed
    by the log agent. When this happens, warnings are emitted indicating that the agent
    failed to make a file tailer for the container log file.
