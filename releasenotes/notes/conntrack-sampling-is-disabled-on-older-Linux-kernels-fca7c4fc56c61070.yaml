# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    On Linux kernel versions < 3.15, conntrack (used for NAT info for connections)
    sampling is not supported, and conntrack updates will be aborted if a higher
    rate of conntrack updates from the system than set by
    system_probe_config.conntrack_rate_limit is detected. This is done to limit
    excessive resource consumption by the netlink conntrack update system. To
    keep using this system even with a high rate of conntrack updates, increase
    the system_probe_config.conntrack_rate_limit. This can potentially lead to
    higher cpu usage.
fixes:

    Exceeding the conntrack rate limit (system_probe_config.conntrack_rate_limit)
    would result in conntrack updates from the system not being processed
    anymore
