# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Update configuration. Before if `unit_names` and `unit_regexes` are not set,
    all units are monitored. Now either `unit_names` or `unit_regexes` must be
    set, and only matching units will be monitored.
  - |
    New configuration `system_bus_socket` has been added.
  - |
    New configuration `max_units` has been added.
  - |
    Several metrics have been renamed.
