    Some HTTP requests sent by the Datadog Agent to Datadog endpoints were including the Datadog API key in the query parameters (in the URL).
    This meant that the keys could potentially have been logged in various locations, for example, in a forward or a reverse proxy server logs the Agent connected to.
    We have updated all requests to not send the API key as a query parameter.
    Anyone who uses a proxy to connect the Agent to Datadog endpoints should make sure their proxy forwards all Datadog headers (patricularly ``DD-Api-Key``).
    Failure to not send all Datadog headers could cause payloads to be rejected by our endpoints.
