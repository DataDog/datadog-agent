# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Prometheus custom checks are now limited to 2000 metrics by default
    to provide users control over the maximum number of custom metrics
    sent in the case of configuration errors or input changes.
    This limit can be changed with the ``max_returned_metrics`` option
    in the check configuration.
