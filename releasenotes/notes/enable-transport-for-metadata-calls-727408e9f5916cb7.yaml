# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Use the default agent transport for host metadata calls.
    This allows usage of the config `no_proxy` setting for host metadata calls.
    By default cloud provider IPs are added to the transport's `no_proxy` list.
    Added config flag `use_proxy_for_cloud_metadata` to disable this behavior.
