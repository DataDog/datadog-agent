# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Added a configuration option to set the API key separately for Live
    Debugger. It can be set via `apm_config.debugger_api_key` or
    `DD_APM_DEBUGGER_API_KEY`.
