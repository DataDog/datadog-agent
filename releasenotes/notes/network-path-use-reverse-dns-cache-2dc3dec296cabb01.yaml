# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    This change reduces the number of DNS queries made by Network Traffic
    based paths in Network Path.
    A cache of reverse DNS lookups is used to reduce the number of DNS
    queries. Additionally, reverse DNS lookups are now performed only
    for private IPs and not for public IPs.
