# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The cluster agent has an external metrics provider feature to allow using Datadog queries in Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscalers.
    It sometimes faces issues like:

      2022-01-01 01:01:01 UTC | CLUSTER | ERROR | (pkg/util/kubernetes/autoscalers/datadogexternal.go:79 in queryDatadogExternal) | Error while executing metric query ... truncated... API returned error: Query timed out

    To mitigate this problem, use the new ``external_metrics_provider.chunk_size`` parameter to reduce the number of queries that are batched by the Agent and sent together to Datadog.
