# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Kubernetes logs integration is now automatically enabled if it can find ``/var/log/pods``.
    If ``logs_config.container_collect_all`` is not enabled, only pods with Datadog logs
    annotation will be collected. If ``logs_config.container_collect_all`` is enabled, logs for
    all pods (matching ``ac_exclude`` and ``ac_include`` filters if applicable) will be collected.
