    Checks defined in the agent core no longer log messages about not finding a
    subclass of the base check.  This error occurred because the agent looked
    first for a Python module and only then fell back to a core module.  The
    default configurations (`<checkname>.yaml.default`) for core modules now
    contain `loader: core`, causing the core loader to be used without first trying
    Python.  Customers with custom configuration for these checks can add a
    similar setting to their configuration files.
