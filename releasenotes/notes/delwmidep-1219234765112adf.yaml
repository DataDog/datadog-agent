    The Windows agent no longer depends on the Windows WMI service.  
    If the WMI service stops for any reason, the Windows agent will no 
    longer stop with it.  However, any integrations that do use WMI
    (wmi_check and win32_event_log) will not be able to function until 
    the WMI service restarts.
