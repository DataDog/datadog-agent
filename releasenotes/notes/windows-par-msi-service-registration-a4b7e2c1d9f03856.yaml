    On Windows, the private action runner binary is now included in the MSI
    installer and registered as the ``datadog-agent-action`` Windows
    service. The service is installed as demand-start with a dependency on the
    main Agent service, and its credentials and ACLs are managed alongside the
    other Agent services during install, upgrade, and repair.
