    Log configurations now accept a new parameter that allows
    to specify whether a log shall be tailed from the beginning
    or the end. It aims to allow whole log collection, including
    events that may occur before the agent first start. The
    parameter is named ``start_position`` and it can be set to
    ``end`` or ``beginning``, the default value is ``end``.
