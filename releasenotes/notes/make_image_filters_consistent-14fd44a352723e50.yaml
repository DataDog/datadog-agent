# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes consistency issue with container image filters.
    Depending on the Agent configuration, filters were sometimes behaving differently
    for metrics and logs. For example, an image filter that worked for excluding logs
    didn't work when used to exclude metrics, and vice versa. 
    The exclusion logic is now consistent between metrics and logs.
