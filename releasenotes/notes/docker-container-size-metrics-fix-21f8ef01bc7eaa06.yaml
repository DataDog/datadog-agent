# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed Docker container size metrics (docker.container.size_rw and 
    docker.container.size_rootfs) not being sent to Datadog when configured 
    via autodiscovery labels. The metrics are now properly collected and sent 
    only when collect_container_size is enabled and the collection frequency 
    conditions are met.
