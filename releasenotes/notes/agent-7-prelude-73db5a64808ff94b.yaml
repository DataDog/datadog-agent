# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

  This release introduces major version 7 of the Datadog Agent, which starts at v7.16.0. The only change from Agent v6 is that
  v7 defaults to Python 3 and only includes support for Python 3. Before upgrading to v7, confirm that any
  custom checks you have are compatible with Python 3. See this `guide <https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/python-3/>`_
  for more information.

  Except for the supported Python versions, v7.16.0 and v6.16.0 have the same features.
