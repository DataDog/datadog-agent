# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add the new metric `kubernetes.pod.terminating.duration` to kubelet check to track pods
    that are stuck in the termination phase. If `deletionTimestamp` is set to a time in the future,`kubernetes.pod.terminating.duration` is only emitted when the current time reaches the time set in `deletionTimestamp`.
