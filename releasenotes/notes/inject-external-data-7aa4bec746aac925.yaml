# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Implement External Data environment variable injection in the Admission Controller.
    Format for this new environment variable is `it-INIT_CONTAINER,cn-CONTAINER_NAME,pu-POD_UID`.
    This new variable is needed for the New Origin Detection spec. It is used for Origin Detection
    in case Local Data are unavailable, for example with Kata Containers and CGroups v2.
