# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Make the log agent continuously retry to connect to docker rather than giving up when docker is not running when the agent is started.
    This is to handle the case where the agent is started while the docker daemon is stopped and the docker daemon is started later while the datadog agent is already running.
