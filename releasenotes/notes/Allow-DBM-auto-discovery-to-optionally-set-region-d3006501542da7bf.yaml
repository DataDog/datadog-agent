    This change allows DBM Autodiscovery users to optionally set the region for where their aurora clusters are running.
    This can be used in lieu of relying on IMDS to discover the region through instance metadata. This is a nicer experience for users
    running in Docker, who would be required to complete extra steps in their instance metadata configuration to allow the Docker container
    access to the instance metadata.
