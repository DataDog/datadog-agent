    UDP packets can be sent in two ways. In the "connected" way, a `connect` call is
    made first to assign the remote/destination address, and then packets get sent with the `send`
    function or `sendto` function with destination address set to NULL. In the "unconnected" way,
    packets get sent using `sendto` function with a non NULL destination address. This fix addresss
    a bug where network stats were not being generated for UDP packets sent using the "unconnected"
    way.
