# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Changed the log level of the "Too many errors for endpoint '*': retrying later" log message
    from ERROR to WARN. This message is emitted when the forwarder temporarily suppresses sending
    transactions to an endpoint that has recently failed, in order to avoid flooding it whilst in
    an error state.
