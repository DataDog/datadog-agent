# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The utilities provided by the `sysstat` package have been removed: the ``iostat``,
    ``mpstat``, ``pidstat``, ``sar``, ``sadf``, ``cifsiostat`` and ``nfsiostat-sysstat``
    binaries have been removed from the packaged Agent. This has no effect on the
    behavior of the Agent and official integrations, but your custom checks may be
    affected if they rely on these embedded binaries.
