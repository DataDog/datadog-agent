# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added config option ``logs_config.tag_truncated_logs``.  When
    enabled, file logs will come with a tag ``truncated:true`` if 
    they were truncated by the Agent.
