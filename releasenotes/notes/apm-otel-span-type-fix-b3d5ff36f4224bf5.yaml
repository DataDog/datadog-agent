# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Datadog span.Type and span.Resource attributes are set correctly for OTel spans 
    processed via OTel Agent and Datadog Exporter when client span type is a database 
    span.Type.

    span.Type logic update is limited to ReceiveResourceSpansV2 logic, set using 
    `"enable_receive_resource_spans_v2"` in `DD_APM_FEATURES`

    span.Resource logic update is limited to OperationAndResourceNameV2 logic, set 
    using `"enable_operation_and_resource_name_logic_v2"` in `DD_APM_FEATURES`

    Users should set a `span.type` attribute on their telemetry if they wish to
    override the default span type.
