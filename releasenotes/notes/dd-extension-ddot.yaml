# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    DDOT now submits Fleet Automation metadata through the upstream datadogextension, which is enabled by default. As a result, your DDOT configuration will now appear under the OTel Collector tab.
    If you configured `otelcollector.converter.features`, you may need to add the `datadog` feature to enable Fleet Automation, as DDOT Fleet Automation metadata is no longer submitted through the `ddflareextension`.
