# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added the "helm_values_as_tags" configuration option in the Helm check.  It
    allows users to collect helm values from a Helm release and use them as
    tags to attach to the metrics and events emitted by the Helm check.
