# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    On some slow drives, when the Agent shuts down suddenly the Logs Agent registry file can become corrupt.
    This means that when the Agent starts again the registry file can't be read and therefore the Logs Agent reads logs from the beginning again.
    With this update, the Agent now attempts to update the registry file atomically to reduce the chances of a corrupted file.
