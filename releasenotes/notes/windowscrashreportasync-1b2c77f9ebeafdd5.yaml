# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    On Windows, the endpoint /windows_crash_detection/check has been modified to report crashes in
    an asynchronous manner, to allow processing of large crash dumps without blocking or timing out.
    The first check will return a busy status and continue to do so until the processing is completed.
