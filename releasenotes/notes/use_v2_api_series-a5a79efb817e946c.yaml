# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    `use_v2_api.series` to true.  This value defaults to false, and
    should only be set to true in internal testing scenarios.  The
    default will change in a future release.
