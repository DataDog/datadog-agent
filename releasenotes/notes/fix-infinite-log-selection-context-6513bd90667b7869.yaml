# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Make context expire with configurable timeout when selecting log source type.
    Infinite context was masking an error of missing runtime sockets.
    With this change, expiring context eventually reflects as log source error in `agent status` log section.
    Timeout value could be changed by setting `logs_config.container_runtime_waiting_timeout` in the Agent configuration file.
    Timeout value provided in seconds.
