# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Datadog Agent had a memory leak where some tags would be collected but
    never cleaned up after their entities were removed from a Kubernetes
    cluster due to their IDs not being recognized. This has now been fixed, and
    all tags are garbage collected when their entities are removed.
