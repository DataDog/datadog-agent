    Fix Gohai not being able to fetch network information when running on a non-English windows (when the output of
    commands like `ipconfig` were not in English). `Gohai` no longer relies on system commands but uses Golang `net` package
    instead (same as Linux hosts).
    This bug had the side effect of preventing network monitoring data to be linked back to the host.

    Gohai dependency has been upgraded. This brings a newer version of gopsutil and a fix when fetching network
    information in non-english Windows (see `fixes` section).
