enhancements:
  - |
    When using a `secret_backend_command` STDERR is always logged with a debug log level. This eases troubleshooting a
    user's `secret_backend_command` in a containerized environment.
  - |
    `secret_backend_timeout` has been increased from 5s to 30s. This increases support for the slow to load
    Python script used for `secret_backend_command`. This was an issue when importing large libraries in a
    containerized environment.
