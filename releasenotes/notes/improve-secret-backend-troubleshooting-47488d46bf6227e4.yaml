enhancements:
  - |
    When using a `secret_backend_command` STDERR will always be logged with a debug log level. This ease troubleshooting
    user's `secret_backend_command` in a containerized environment.
  - |
    `secret_backend_timeout` has been increased from 5s to 30s. This will help better support, for example, slow to load
    Python script used for `secret_backend_command`. This could have been an issue when importing large librairies in a
    containerized environment.
