# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    All datadog public endpoints have the maximum requirements to close idle
    connections after 60s being idle.  If a given client keeps it for longer,
    the server will close it, and the client will likely see the issue during
    the next write, leading to a connection reset error.  The idle timeout
    should be therefore set under a minute.
    This PR is reducing the timeout from 90 to 30s.
