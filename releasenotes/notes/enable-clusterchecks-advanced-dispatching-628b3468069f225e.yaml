    The Cluster Agent now enables both `DD_CLUSTER_CHECKS_ADVANCED_DISPATCHING_ENABLED`
    and `DD_CLUSTER_CHECKS_REBALANCE_WITH_UTILIZATION` by default.
    These options are now set to `true` in both the configuration template and the code,
    improving cluster check dispatching and balancing based on node utilization out-of-the-box.
    To disable these features, a user must now explicitly set them to `false` with the following config options:
      - name: DD_CLUSTER_CHECKS_ADVANCED_DISPATCHING_ENABLED
        value: "false"
      - name: DD_CLUSTER_CHECKS_REBALANCE_WITH_UTILIZATION
        value: "false"
