    Disk check: Added concurrency guardrails to prevent thread explosion when
    remote mounts (NFS/CIFS) become unresponsive. When a remote filesystem
    blocks in kernel uninterruptible sleep (D state), the disk check now limits
    concurrent disk usage calls with a global semaphore (max 8) and per-mountpoint
    inflight tracking. This prevents unbounded OS thread growth that could cause
    Agent instability. Trade-off: if a mount wedges, usage metrics for that mount
    are skipped, but the Agent remains healthy.
