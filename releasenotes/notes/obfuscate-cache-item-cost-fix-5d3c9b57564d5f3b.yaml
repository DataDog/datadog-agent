# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Obfuscation Cache Size Calculation:
    Resolved an issue where the cache item size was underestimated by not accounting for the Go struct overhead (including struct fields and headers for strings and slices).
    This fix ensures a more accurate calculation of cache item memory usage, leading to better memory efficiency and preventing over-allocation of NumCounters in cache configurations.
