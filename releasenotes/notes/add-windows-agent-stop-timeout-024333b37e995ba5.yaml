    Add a stop timeout to the Windows Agent services. If an Agent service
    does not cleanly stop within 15 seconds after receiving a stop command
    from the Service Control Manager, the service will hard stop.
    The timeout can be configured by setting the DD_WINDOWS_SERVICE_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
    environment variable.
    Agent stop timeouts are logged to the Windows Event Log and can be monitored and alerted on.
