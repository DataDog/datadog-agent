# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - Added a new feature flag `disable_operation_and_resource_name_logic_v2` in DD_APM_FEATURES that replaces `enable_operation_and_resource_name_logic_v2`. The new operation name logic for OTLP is now opt-out instead of opt-in.
