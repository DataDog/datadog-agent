# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The logs collection pipeline has been through a refactor to support 
    processing only the message content (instead of the whole raw message)
    in the journald and Windows events tailers.
    This feature is experimental and off by default since it changes how
    existing `log_processing_rules` behaves with journald and Windows events
    tailer.
    Note that it will be switched on by default in a future release of the Agent.
    A warning notifying about this is shown when the journald and Windows events
    tailers are used with some `log_processing_rules`.
