# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The logs collection pipeline has been through a refactor to support 
    processing only the message content (instead of the whole raw message)
    in the journald & windows events tailers.
    This feature is experimental and off by default since it changes how
    existing `log_processing_rules` behaves with journald & windows events
    tailer.
    Note that it'll be switched on by default in a future release of the Agent.
    A warning notifying about this is visible when the journald & windows events
    tailers are used with some `log_processing_rules`.
