# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

   The OTLP endpoint will no longer enable the legacy OTLP/HTTP endpoint 0.0.0.0:55681 by default. To keep using the legacy endpoint, explicitly declare it via the ``otlp_config.receiver.protocols.http.endpoint`` configuration setting or its associated environment variable, ``DD_OTLP_CONFIG_RECEIVER_PROTOCOLS_HTTP_ENDPOINT``.
