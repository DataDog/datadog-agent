# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Add a new Probabilistic Sampler sampling mechanism, which is
    compatible with OpenTelemetry's Probabilistic Sampling Processor.

    APM: While adding another sampler, we have modified the Rare sampler
    so that it no longer has a separate TTL for priority traces, meaning
    it no longer distinguishes between traces with priority > 0 and
    priority <= 0. It is necessary to detangle the various samplers so
    they can work independently from each other, in this case, so the
    Rare sampler can work with the Probabilistic Sampler. This should not
    have a noticeable impact on users.
