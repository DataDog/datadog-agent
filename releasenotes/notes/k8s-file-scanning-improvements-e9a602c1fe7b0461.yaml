# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Kubernetes pod with short-lived containers won't have a few logs of lines
    duplicated with both container tag (the stopped one and the running one) anymore
    while logs are being collected.
    Mount ``/var/log/containers`` and use ``logs_config.validate_pod_container_id``
    to enable this feature.
