# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    ``service_monitoring_config.enable_kafka_monitoring`` is deprecated and replaced by ``service_monitoring_config.kafka.enabled``.
    ``service_monitoring_config.max_kafka_stats_buffered`` is deprecated and replaced by ``service_monitoring_config.kafka.max_stats_buffered``.
    The old configuration keys will continue to work but users are encouraged to migrate to the new tree structure for consistency with other protocol configurations.
