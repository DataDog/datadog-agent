# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Partial support of IPv6 on EKS clusters
    * Fix the kubelet client when the IP of the host is IPv6.
    * Fix the substitution of `%%host%%` patterns inside the auto-discovery annotations:
      If the concerned pod has an IPv6 and the `%%host%%` pattern appears inside an URL context, then the IPv6 is surrounded by square brackets.
