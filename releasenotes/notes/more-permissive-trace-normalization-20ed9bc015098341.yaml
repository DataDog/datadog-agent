# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: the trace agent now lets through a wider variety of traces, automatically correcting some malformed traces
    instead of dropping them. The following fields are now replaced with reasonable defaults if invalid or empty
    and truncated if exceeding max length: `span.service`, `span.name`, `span.resource`, `span.type`.
    `span.duration=0` is now allowed. Missing span start date now defaults to `duration - now`. The
    `datadog.trace_agent.receiver.traces_dropped` metric is now tagged with a `reason` tag explaining the reason
    it was dropped. There is a new `datadog.trace_agent.receiver.spans_malformed` metric also tagged by `reason`
    explaining how the span was malformed.
