    The `args_flags` and `args_options` were added to the SECL
    language to ease the writing of runtime security rules based
    on command line arguments.
    `args_flags` is used to catch arguments that start by either one
    or two hyphen characters but do not accept any associated value.

    Examples:

    - `version` is part of `args_flags` for the command `cat --version`
    - `l` and `n` both are in `args_flags` for the command `netstat -ln`
    - `T=8` and `width=8` both are in `args_options` for the command
      `ls -T 8 --width=8`.
