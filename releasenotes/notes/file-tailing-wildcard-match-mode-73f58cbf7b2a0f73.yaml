# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    A new config option, ``logs_config.file_wildcard_selection_mode``, 
    allows you to configure how log wildcard file matches are
    prioritized if the number of matches exceeds ``logs_config.open_files_limit``.

    The option defaults to ``by_name`` which is the previous behavior.
    The new option is ``by_modification_time`` which prioritizes more recently
    modified files, but using it can result in slower performance compared to using ``by_name``.
