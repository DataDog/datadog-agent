# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    A new config option ``logs_config.file_wildcard_selection_mode`` has been added.
    This option allows users to configure how log wildcard file matches are
    prioritized if the number of matches exceeds ``logs_config.open_files_limit``

    This defaults to ``by_name`` which is the current behavior.
    The new option is ``by_modification_time`` which will prioritize more recently
    modified files, but it comes with a performance penalty compared to ``by_name``.
