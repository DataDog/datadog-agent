# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The auto instrumentation, config, and tags from labels webhooks have been decoupled to function independently. The following settings will now apply exclusively to the auto instrumentation webhook:
    - `apm_config.instrumentation.enabled`
    - `apm_config.instrumentation.enabled_namespaces`
    - `apm_config.instrumentation.disabled_namespaces`

    These settings will no longer apply to the config or tags from labels webhooks. To maintain the existing behavior, configure these settings separately for each webhook.

    For the config webhook, use the following settings:
    - `admission_controller.inject_config.enabled`
    - `admission_controller.inject_config.enabled_namespaces`
    - `admission_controller.inject_config.disabled_namespaces`

    For the tags from labels webhook, use the following settings:
    - `admission_controller.inject_tags.enabled`
    - `admission_controller.inject_tags.enabled_namespaces`
    - `admission_controller.inject_tags.disabled_namespaces`
