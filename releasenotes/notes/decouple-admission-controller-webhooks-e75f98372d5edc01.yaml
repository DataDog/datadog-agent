# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The auto instrumentation, config, and tags from labels webhooks have been
    decoupled so that they function independently. These settings will now only
    apply to the auto instrumentation webhook:
    - `apm_config.instrumentation.enabled`
    - `apm_config.instrumentation.enabled_namespaces`
    - `apm_config.instrumentation.disabled_namespaces`

    These settings will no longer apply to the config or tags from labels
    webhooks. If you want to maintain the existing behavior, you will need to
    configure the settings for each webhook separately.

    For the config webhook, you can use the following settings:
    - `admission_controller.inject_config.enabled`
    - `admission_controller.inject_config.enabled_namespaces`
    - `admission_controller.inject_config.disabled_namespaces`

    For the tags from labels webhook, you can use the following settings:
    - `admission_controller.inject_tags.enabled`
    - `admission_controller.inject_tags.enabled_namespaces`
    - `admission_controller.inject_tags.disabled_namespaces`
