    Fix an issue introduced in 7.73.0 that can cause the MSI to overwrite the ``site`` option in ``datadog.yaml`` with the default value of ``datadoghq.com``.

    This issue impacts users who do not provide the ``SITE`` option to the MSI when upgrading AND who have an error in their ``datadog.yaml`` file that prevents the MSI from reading the existing ``site`` option (MSI log contains ``ReadConfig. User config could not be read``).

    This issue also impacts users of ``datadog-installer.exe`` and ``Install-Datadog.ps1``, introduced in 7.72.0, who do not provide the ``DD_SITE`` environment variable when upgrading.
