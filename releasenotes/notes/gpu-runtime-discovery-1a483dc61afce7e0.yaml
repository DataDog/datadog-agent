# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

features:
  - |
    Added GPU runtime discovery support for ECS EC2 environments. The Datadog Agent
    can now detect GPU device UUIDs assigned to containers by extracting the
    ``NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` environment variable from the Docker container configuration.
    This enables GPU-to-container mapping for GPU metrics without requiring the
    Kubernetes PodResources API, which is not available in ECS environments.
enhancements:
  - |
    Added ``GPUDeviceIDs`` field to the workloadmeta Container entity to store
    GPU device UUIDs. This field is populated by the Docker collector in ECS
    environments from the ``NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` environment variable
    (e.g., ``GPU-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx``).
  - |
    The GPU collector now uses ``GPUDeviceIDs`` from workloadmeta as the primary
    source for GPU-to-container mapping in ECS, with fallback to procfs for
    regular Docker environments and PodResources API for Kubernetes.
