    Remote Agent updates on Windows now checks if the custom Agent password
    is available before updating the Agent. This prevents the update from
    failing later and leaving the host without an Agent installed.

    This is only applicable to domain joined hosts using a custom Agent
    username and password. See
    [Agent 7.66.0 upgrade notes](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/releases/tag/7.66.0)
    for more information.
