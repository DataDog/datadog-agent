# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Enables new option by default `otlp_config.traces.compute_top_level_by_span_kind` to enable new logic to improve top-level spans identification in OTLP ingest.
    - If set to true, root spans and spans with a server or consumer `span.kind` will be marked as top-level. Additionally, spans with a client or producer `span.kind` will have stats computed.
    - If set to false, this new logic will be disabled and OpenTelemetry spans may be misidentified as top-level.
