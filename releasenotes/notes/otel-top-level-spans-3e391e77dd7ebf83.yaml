# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    OTLP ingest now has a feature flag to identify top-level spans by span kind. This new logic can be enabled by adding `enable_otlp_compute_top_level_by_span_kind` in DD_APM_FEATURES.
    - With this new logic, root spans and spans with a server or consumer `span.kind` will be marked as top-level. Additionally, spans with a client or producer `span.kind` will have stats computed.
    - Enabling this feature flag may increase the number of spans that generate trace metrics, and may change which spans appear as top-level in Datadog.
