# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    prefix from ``kubernetes_core`` to ``kubernetes`` so that it can replace 
    the Python ``kubelet`` check.
