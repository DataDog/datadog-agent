# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: DogStatsD data can now be proxied through the "/dogstatsd/v1/proxy" endpoint
    and the new "/dogstatsd/v2/proxy" endpoint over UDS, with multiple payloads
    separated by newlines in a single request body.
    See https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd#setup for configuration details.
