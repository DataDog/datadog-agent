    The security agent will fail immediately if the first of either the default config files or user-provided override config files are inaccessible.
    The default config files are still datadog.yaml and security-agent.yaml, and loaded in that order.
    Previously, if the security agent was started with at least one accessible config file, no matter what order, the security agent would still be able to start.
