    The security agent will fail quickly if the first of either the default, or if they exist, user-provided override config files are inaccessible.
    The default config files are still datadog.yaml and security-agent.yaml, in that order.
    Previously, if the security agent was started with at least one accessible config file, no matter the order, the agent would still be able to start.
