    When ``ec2_collect_tags`` is enabled, the Agent now attempts to fetch data
    from the instance metadata service, falling back to the existing
    EC2-API-based method of fetching tags.  Support for tags in the instance
    metadata service is an opt-in EC2 feature, so this functionality will
    not work automatically.
