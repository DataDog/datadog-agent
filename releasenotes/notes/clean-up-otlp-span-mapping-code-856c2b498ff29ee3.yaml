# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Change how attribute precedence is handled. All fields are now evaluated across both span and resource attributes, using the following order of precedence (from highest to lowest):

    - datadog.* span attributes
    - datadog.* resource attributes
    - standard span attributes
    - standard resource attributes
