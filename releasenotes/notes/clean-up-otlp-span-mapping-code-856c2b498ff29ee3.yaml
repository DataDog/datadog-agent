# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Change how precedence of attributes is handled. All fields are now checked for in both span and resource level attributes, with the following order of precedence, from highest to lowest:

    - datadog.* span attributes
    - datadog.* resource attributes
    - standard span attributes
    - standard resource attributes
