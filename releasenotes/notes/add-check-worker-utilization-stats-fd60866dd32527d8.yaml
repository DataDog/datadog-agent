# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added tracking of check worker utilization.
    Utilization stats can be seen using the `agent status` command.
    In addition, the Datadog Agent will log a warning if a worker's utilization exceeds a threshold (95% by default).
