# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix how Kubernetes events forwarding detects the Node/Host. 
    * Previously Nodes' events were not always attached to the correct host.
    * Pods' events from "custom" controllers might still be not attached to
      a host if the controller doesn't set the host in the `source.host` event's field.
