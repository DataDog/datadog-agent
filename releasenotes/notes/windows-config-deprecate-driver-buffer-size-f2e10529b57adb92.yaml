# Each section from every release note is combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    - Decreases number of `ReadFile` calls when querying the Windows driver.
    - Adds `network_config.windows.driver_buffer_entries` configuration
      parameter to `system-probe.yaml`. This value specifies the number
      of entries that the Windows driver can return to the system-probe.
      This value is dynamically resized (increased or decreased) depending on
      the number of connections the Windows driver is tracking. For example,
      if the value is `50` then the Windows driver can return information about
      `50` tracked connections at once. If there are more than `50` connections,
      the `system-probe` will re-query the driver to get the remaining connections.
deprecations:
  - |
    In `system-probe.yaml`, `system_probe_config.windows.driver_buffer_size` is
    deprecated (but still supported) in favor of
    `network_config.windows.driver_buffer_entries`.
