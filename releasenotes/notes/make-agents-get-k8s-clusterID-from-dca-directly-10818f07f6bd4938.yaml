# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    We improved the way Agents get the Kubernetes cluster ID from the Cluster Agent.
    It used to be that the cluster agent would create a configmap which had to be
    mounted as an env variable in the agent daemonset, blocking the process-agent
    from starting if not found. Now the process-agent will start, only the Kubernetes
    Resources collection will be blocked.
