# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Improve SQL text collection for self-managed installations. The Agent selects text from `V$SQL` instead of `V$SQLSTATS`. If it isn't possible to query the text, the Agent tries to identify the context, such as parsing or closing cursor, and put it in the SQL text.
