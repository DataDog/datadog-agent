# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Agent expvar metrics now have default values. Metrics like the number of
    packets dropped by the agent or errors were previously not reported until a
    first event occurred. This should make it easier to use the expvar
    configuration ``agent_stats.yaml``.
