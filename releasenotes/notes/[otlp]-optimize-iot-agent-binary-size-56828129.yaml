# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Optimize OTLP binary size for IoT Agent builds by conditionally excluding unnecessary components.
    The IoT Agent now automatically skips debug exporters, infrastructure attributes processors,
    and detailed telemetry metrics that are typically not needed in IoT deployments.
    This reduces the binary size by approximately 50KB while maintaining full OTLP functionality
    for metrics, traces, and logs ingestion. Standard Agent builds are unaffected and retain
    all OTLP features.
