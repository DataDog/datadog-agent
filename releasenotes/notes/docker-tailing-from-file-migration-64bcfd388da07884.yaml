    Improve migration path when shifting docker container tailing
    from the socket to file. If tailing from file for Docker
    containers is enabled, container with an existing entry
    relative to a socket tailer will continue being tailed
    from the Docker socket unless the following newly introduced
    option is set to true:  ``logs_config.docker_container_force_use_file``
    It aims to allow smooth transition to file tailing for Docker
    containers.
