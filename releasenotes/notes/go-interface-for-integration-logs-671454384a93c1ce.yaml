# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    This change adds a Go interface for logs coming from integrations. The RTLoader will be able to use this interface to send logs directly to the Agent from integrations.
