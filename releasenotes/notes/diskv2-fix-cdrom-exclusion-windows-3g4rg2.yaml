    Windows: Fix CD-ROM drives being monitored by the disk check since Agent 7.73.0.
    The diskv2 check now uses the Windows ``GetDriveType()`` API to properly
    detect and exclude CD-ROM drives, matching the behavior of the previous
    Python disk check. This fixes false alerts on ``system.disk.in_use`` for
    CD-ROM drives with inserted media.
