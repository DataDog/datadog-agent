# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Fix a bug introduced in Agent versions 7.44 and 6.44 that
    changed the expected strings separator from comma to space when
    multiple features are defined in DD_APM_FEATURES.
    Now either separator can be used (for example, DD_APM_FEATURES="feat1,feat2" or DD_APM_FEATURES="feat1 feat2").
