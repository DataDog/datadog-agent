# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    ``forwarder_retry_queue_payloads_max_size`` takes precedence over the deprecated
    ``forwarder_retry_queue_max_size``. If ``forwarder_retry_queue_max_size`` 
    is not set, you are not affected by this change. If 
    ``forwarder_retry_queue_max_size`` is set, but 
    ``forwarder_retry_queue_payloads_max_size`` is not set, the Agent uses
    ``forwarder_retry_queue_max_size * 2MB`` 
    as the value of ``forwarder_retry_queue_payloads_max_size``. It is 
    recommended to configure ``forwarder_retry_queue_payloads_max_size`` and 
    remove ``forwarder_retry_queue_max_size`` from the Agent configuration.
