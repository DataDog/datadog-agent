# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Enable IMDSv2 by default for all EC2 instance hosts if IMDSv2 usage was not explicitly enabled.
upgrade:
  - |
    Enables IMDSv2 by default on all EC2 instance hosts by updating the``ec2_imdsv2_transition_payload_enabled`` flag from ``false`` to ``true``.
    If IMDSv2 hasn’t been explicitly enabled and the hostname isn’t set to the instance ID, the display name may change to the instance ID without affecting Agent behavior.
    For more information, see the `IMDSv2 Enablement by Default <https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/ec2_imdsv2_transition_payload_enabled/>`.
