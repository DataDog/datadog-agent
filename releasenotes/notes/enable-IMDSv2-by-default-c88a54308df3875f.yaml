# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Change ``ec2_imdsv2_transition_payload_enabled`` from ``false`` to ``true``.
    Enable IMDSv2 by default for all EC2 instance hosts if IMDSv2 usage was not explicitly enabled.
    Hostname display may change to the instance ID if it wasn't already set to the instance ID. Nonetheless, it should not affect the Agent behavior.
