# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

upgrade:
  - |
    None. This change is backward-compatible and does not modify behavior unless users explicitly set new environment variables.

features:
  - |
    The Windows Agent install script (`Install-Datadog.ps1`) now supports setting host tags and enabling logs collection at install time via the `DD_TAGS` and `DD_LOGS_ENABLED` environment variables. This allows users to configure tags and logs without post-install edits to `datadog.yaml`.

enhancements:
  - |
    Added detection and replacement of `tags:` blocks in `datadog.yaml` to ensure only top-level, uncommented, and non-nested tags are modified during install.

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue where `DD_TAGS` and `DD_LOGS_ENABLED` were silently ignored during install, requiring manual configuration edits.
