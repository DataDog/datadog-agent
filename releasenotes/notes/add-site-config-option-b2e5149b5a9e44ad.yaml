# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Support a new config option, ``site``, that allows setting the Datadog site
    to which the Agent should send data. ``dd_url`` is still supported and, when set,
    overrides ``site``.
