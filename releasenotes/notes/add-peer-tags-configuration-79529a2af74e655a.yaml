# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: [BETA] Adds `peer_tags` configuration to allow for more tags in APM stats that
    can add granularity and clarity to a `peer.service`. To set this config, use
    ``DD_APM_PEER_TAGs='["aws.s3.bucket", "db.instance", ...]`` or
    ``apm_config.peer_tags: ["aws.s3.bucket", "db.instance", ...]`` in datadog.yaml.
    Please note that ``DD_APM_PEER_SERVICE_AGGREGATION`` or ``apm_config.peer_service_aggregation`` must also be set to ``true``.
