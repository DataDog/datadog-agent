# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    NDM: The SNMP integration now collects ``ifType`` (OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3) for all network interfaces
    and includes it in the interface metadata payload. This field identifies the type of each interface
    (e.g., ethernetCsmacd, softwareLoopback, tunnel) according to the IANAifType MIB.
