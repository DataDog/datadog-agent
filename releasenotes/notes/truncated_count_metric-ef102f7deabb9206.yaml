# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added a new `logs.truncated` metric to the Agent that reports the number of logs truncated before being sent. This metric helps monitor log volume loss due to truncation and is tagged by `service` and `source` for better visibility.
