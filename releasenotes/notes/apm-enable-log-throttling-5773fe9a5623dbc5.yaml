# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Log throttling is now automatically enabled by default when
    `log_level` differs from `debug`. A maximum of no more than 10 error
    messages every 10 seconds will be displayed. If you had it enabled before,
    it can now be removed from the config file.
