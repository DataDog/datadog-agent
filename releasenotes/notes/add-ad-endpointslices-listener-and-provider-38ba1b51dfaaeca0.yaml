    As of Kubernetes version 1.33, the ``Endpoint`` API object has been deprecated in favor of ``EndpointSlice``.
    As such Autodiscovery now supports the use of a ``EndpointSlice`` listener and provider to collect endpoint checks.
    To enable this feature, set ``kubernetes_use_endpoint_slices`` to true in your Datadog Agent configuration.
