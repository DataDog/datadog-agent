# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: DD_APM_MAX_TPS config setting is deprecated in favor of the more
    accurate DD_APM_TARGET_TPS. Accordingly, when configured via yaml,
    max_traces_per_second is deprecated in favor of target_traces_per_second.
