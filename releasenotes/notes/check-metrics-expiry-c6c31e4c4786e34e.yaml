    Reduce memory usage when checks report new metrics every run. Most metrics are removed
    after two check runs without new samples. Rate, historate and monotonic count will be
    kept in memory for additional 25 hours after that. Number of check runs and the
    additional time can be changed with `check_sampler_bucket_commits_count_expiry` and
    `check_sampler_stateful_metric_expiration_time`. Metric expiration can be disabled
    entirely by setting `check_sampler_expire_metrics` to `false`.
