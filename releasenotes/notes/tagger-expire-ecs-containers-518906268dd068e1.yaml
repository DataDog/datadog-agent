# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes a bug where the Agent would hold on to tags from stopped ECS EC2 (but
    not Fargate) tags forever, resulting in increased memory consumption on EC2
    instances handling a lot of short scheduled tasks.
