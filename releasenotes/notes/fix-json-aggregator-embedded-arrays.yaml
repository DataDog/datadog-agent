# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes a bug in the auto multiline JSON aggregator where pretty-printed JSON arrays
    and JSON embedded after a text prefix (e.g. ``timestamp error: [``) could not be
    aggregated. Root-level arrays are now supported and text prefixes preceding an
    opening ``{`` or ``[`` are preserved during aggregation. Non-JSON suffixes
    following the closing delimiter (e.g. ``} END_OF_LOG``) are also preserved when
    a text prefix is present.
