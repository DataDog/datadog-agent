# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    GOMAXPROCS is now set automatically to match the allocated CPU cgroup quota.
    GOMAXPROCS can now also be manually specified and overridden in millicore units.
    If no quota or GOMAXPROCS value is set it will default to the original behavior.
