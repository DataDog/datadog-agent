# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

# must be readable independently of the other.

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    AutoDiscovery can now monitor unready pods.
    It looks for a new pod annotation "ad.datadoghq.com/tolerate-unready"
    which, if set to `true` will make AutoDiscovery monitor that pod
    regardless of its readiness state.
