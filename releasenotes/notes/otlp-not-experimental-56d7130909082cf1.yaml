# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The OTLP ingest endpoint is now considered stable for traces.
    The configuration for it needs no longer be part of the "experimental" config section.

    Support for the "experimental.otlp" section and the DD_OTLP_GRPC_PORT and DD_OTLP_HTTP_PORT
    environment variables will be removed in Agent 7.37.
