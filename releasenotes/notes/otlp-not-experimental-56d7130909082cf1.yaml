# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The OTLP ingest endpoint is now considered public beta to be on par with current OpenTelemetry
    Collector Receiver status. The configuration for it needs no longer be part of the "experimental"
    config section.

    Please note that previously setting "experimental.otlp.grpc_port" together with "apm_config.apm_non_local_traffic"
    would result in the listener being bound to "0.0.0.0" whereas now it will be bound to "localhost" or the value set
    by "bind_host".
