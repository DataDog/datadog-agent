# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The OTLP ingest endpoint is now considered stable for traces.
    Its configuration is located in the `top-level ``otlp_config`` section <https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/7.35.0/pkg/config/config_template.yaml#L2915-L2918>`_.

    Support for the deprecated ``experimental.otlp`` section and the ``DD_OTLP_GRPC_PORT`` and ``DD_OTLP_HTTP_PORT``
    environment variables will be removed in Agent 7.37. Use the ``otlp_config`` section or the
    ``DD_OTLP_CONFIG_RECEIVER_PROTOCOLS_GRPC_ENDPOINT`` and ``DD_OTLP_CONFIG_RECEIVER_PROTOCOLS_HTTP_ENDPOINT``
    environment variables instead.
