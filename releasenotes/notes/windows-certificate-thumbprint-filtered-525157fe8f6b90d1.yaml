# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

     Windows: `windows_certificate` now populates the `certificate_thumbprint` tag
     when `certificate_subjects` filters are used. Previously, the tag was empty,
     making it impossible to uniquely scope monitors in environments with duplicate subjects.
