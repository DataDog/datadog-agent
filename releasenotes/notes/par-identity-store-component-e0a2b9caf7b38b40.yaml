# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Private Action Runner now supports storing identity credentials in Kubernetes secrets.
    Configure with ``private_action_runner.identity_store.kind``
    set to ``k8s-secret`` to enable Kubernetes secret storage. The implementation is
    backward compatible, defaulting to file-based storage when not explicitly configured.
