    Policy can now define macros with items specified as a YAML list
    instead of a SECL expression, as

      ```
      - my_macro:
        values:
          - value1
          - value2
      ```

    In addition, macros and rules can now be updated in later loaded policies
    (`default.policy` is loaded first, the other policies in the folder are loaded
    in alphabetical order).

    The previous macro can be modified with:

      ```
      - my_macro:
        combine: merge
        values:
          - value3
      ```

    It can also be overriden with:

      ```
      - my_macro:
        combine: override
        values:
          - my-single-value
      ```

    Rules can now also be disabled with:
      ```
      - my_rule:
        disabled: true
      ````
