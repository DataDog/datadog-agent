# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    along with the maximum allowed payload body from 10MB to 50MB. This can result
    in an increase in tracing data but will guarantee better integrity.
