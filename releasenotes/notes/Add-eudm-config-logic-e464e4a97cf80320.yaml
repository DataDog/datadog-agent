# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added support for ``infrastructure_mode: end_user_device`` configuration option.
    When enabled, this mode automatically activates key monitoring features tailored for 
    end-user devices including process collection, software inventory tracking, and 
    notable events monitoring. These settings can still be individually overridden in 
    the configuration file if needed.
