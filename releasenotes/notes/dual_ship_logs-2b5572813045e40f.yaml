# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    `additional_endpoints` in the `logs_config` now uses the same compression
    configuration as the main endpoint when sending to HTTP destinations. Agents 
    that relied on using different compression settings for `additional_endpoints`
    may need to be reconfigured.
