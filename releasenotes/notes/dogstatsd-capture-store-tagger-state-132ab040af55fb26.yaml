# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Tagger state will now be stored for dogstatsd UDS traffic captures
    with origin detection. The feature will track the incoming traffic,
    building a map of traffic source processes and their source containers,
    then storing the relevant tagger state into the capture file. This will
    allow to not only replay the traffic, but also load a snapshot of the
    tagger state to properly tag replayed payloads in the dogstatsd pipeline.
