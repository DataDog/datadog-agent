# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add a new feature called ``DD_APM_PROBABILISTIC_SAMPLER_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES``.
    This feature is available when ``DD_APM_PROBABILISTIC_SAMPLER_ENABLED=true``.
    It allows to define regular expression for the service, operation_name,
    resource_name, and attributes of the root span.
    If any span matches a defined rule, the sampling percentage specifie in that
    rule will override ``DD_APM_PROBABILISTIC_SAMPLER_SAMPLING_PERCENTAGE``.
    Multiple rules can be configuredâ€”within a single rule, conditions are
    combined using AND, while multiple rules are combined using OR.
    See https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/pull/34232 for example configs.
