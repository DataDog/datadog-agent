    On Windows, the TCP socket transport mechanism for system probe
    communications has been replaced with a named pipe.
    This entails that the system_probe_config.sysprobe_socket configuration
    entry for Windows is deprecated.
    The new fixed named pipe path is \\.\pipe\dd_system_probe.
