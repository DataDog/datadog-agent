# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Users can use ``DD_ORCHESTRATOR_EXPLORER_CUSTOM_SENSITIVE_ANNOTATIONS_LABELS`` to remove sensitive annotations and labels.
    For example: ``DD_ORCHESTRATOR_EXPLORER_CUSTOM_SENSITIVE_ANNOTATIONS_LABELS="sensitive-key-1 sensitive-key-2"``.
    Keys should be separated by spaces. The agent removes any annotations and labels matching these keys.
