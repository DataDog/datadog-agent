# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Added a new endpoint tracer_flare/v1/. This endpoint acts as a 
    proxy to forward HTTP POST request from tracers to the serverless_flare 
    endpoint, allowing tracer flares to be triggered via remote config, improving
    the support experience by automating the collection of logs.
