# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added support for obfuscation for valkey command. This feature is enabled by default.
    To disable it, set ``DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_VALKEY_ENABLED=false``.
    To replace all valkey command arguments with a single ``?``,
    set ``DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_VALKEY_REMOVE_ALL_ARGS=true`` (default: false).
