# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed a bug where logs forwarded by UDP would not be split because of missing line feed character at the end of a datagram.
    Now adding a line feed character at the end of each frame is deprecated because it is automatically added by the agent on read operations.
