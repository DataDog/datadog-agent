# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    A new implementation of auto multi-line detection for logs is now available.
    This new implementation is more flexible and powerful than the previous one. 
    It now supports arbitrary timestamps, continuous matching, and more flexible configuration.
    It will be enabled automatically when ``logs_config.auto_multi_line_detection`` is set to ``true``.
    You can opt out of the new implementation by setting ``logs_config.force_auto_multi_line_detection_v1`` to ``true``.
