    Custom checks (located by default on Linux in ``/etc/datadog-agent/checks.d/``) now have a
    *lower* precedence than the checks that are bundled with the Agent. This means that a custom
    check with the same name as a bundled check will now be ignored, and the bundled check will be
    loaded instead. If you want to override a bundled check with a custom check, please use a
    new name for your custom check, and use that new name for the related yaml configuration file.
