    On Windows, changes the configuration for Process Agent and Trace 
    Agent services to be manual-start.  There is no impact if the 
    services are configured to be active; however, if they're disabled, 
    will stop the behavior where they're briefly started then stopped, 
    which creates excessive Windows service alert.
