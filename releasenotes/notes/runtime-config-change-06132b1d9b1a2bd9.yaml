    Add the ability to change log_level at runtime. The agent command
    has been extended to support new operation. For example to set
    the log_level to debug the following command should be used:
    ``agent config set log_level debug``, all runtime-configurable
    settings can be listed using ``agent config list-runtime``. The
    log_level may also be fetched using the ``agent config get log_level``
    command. Additional runtime-editable setting can easily be added
    by following this implementation.
