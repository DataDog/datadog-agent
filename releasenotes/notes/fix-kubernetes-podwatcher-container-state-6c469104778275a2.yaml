# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    node_kubelet``, the Agent reported incorrect values for the
    ``kubernetes_state.container.status_report.count.waiting`` metric.
