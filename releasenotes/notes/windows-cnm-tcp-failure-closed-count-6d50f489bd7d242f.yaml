# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed an issue on Windows where Cloud Network Monitoring reported TCP
    failure rates greater than 100%. The Windows kernel driver can report a
    TCP failure (reset, timeout, or refused connection) without also setting
    the flow-closed flag. The agent now correctly marks any connection with a
    TCP failure as closed.
