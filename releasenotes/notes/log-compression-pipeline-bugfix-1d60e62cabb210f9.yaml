# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed an issue where non-logs pipelines (agent_telemetry, database_monitoring, 
    network_device, container, sbom, service_discovery, compliance, runtime_security) 
    were not properly inheriting the shared pipeline compression settings from 
    logs_config.compression_kind.
