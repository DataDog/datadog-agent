# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Oracle integration will now auto-adjust the size of the SQL substring requested by the activity sampler
    to better support users with multi-byte character sets, for example, Korean, Arabic, etc. This should
    alleviate crashes caused by long queries using these characters.
