# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Pretty printed/multi-line JSON messages are now aggregated into a single line when auto multiline
    detection is enabled. This ensures the log is treated a structured log when processed by Datadog.
    Aggregation can be disabled by setting ``logs_config.auto_multi_line.enable_json_aggregation`` to ``false``.
