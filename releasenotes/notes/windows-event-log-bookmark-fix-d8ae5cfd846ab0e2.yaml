# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed an issue where the Windows Event Log tailer could lose historical events (the 'amnesia bug') when it started with no prior bookmark and no events were processed immediately. The Agent now correctly seeds an initial bookmark from the most recent event upon startup, ensuring no events are missed on subsequent runs.
