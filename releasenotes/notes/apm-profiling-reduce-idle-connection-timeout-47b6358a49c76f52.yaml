# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Connections to upload profiles to the Datadog intake are now closed
    after 47 seconds of idleness. Common tracer setups send one profile every
    60 seconds, which coincides with the intake's connection timeout and would
    occasionally lead to errors.
