# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed Windows installer overwriting ``install_info`` from setup scripts.
    When using Fleet Automation setup scripts, the subsequent MSI installation
    now skips writing ``install_info`` via a new ``SKIP_INSTALL_INFO`` flag,
    preserving the original setup script installation method tracking.
