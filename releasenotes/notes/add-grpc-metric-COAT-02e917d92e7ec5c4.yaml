# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added the following agent telemetry metrics for debugging gRPC communication within the agent:
    
    | Metric Name                     | Type      | Description                                           |
    | ------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | `grpc.request_count`            | Counter   | Total number of gRPC requests processed by the agent   |
    | `grpc.error_count`              | Counter   | Total number of gRPC errors encountered by the agent   |
    | `grpc.request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Distribution of gRPC request latencies for agent communication |
    | `grpc.payload_size_bytes`       | Histogram | Distribution of payload sizes for gRPC calls within the agent |
    | `grpc.active_requests`          | Gauge     | Number of currently active (in-flight) gRPC requests in the agent |
