# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Use FQDNs when the Agent builds intake hostnames with ``DD_SITE`` to prevent generating as many DNS queries as there are entries in the ``search`` section of the ``/etc/resolv.conf` file.
    If an intake full URL is explicitly set with a ``dd_url`` parameter, then, the parameter is used as-is and using FQDNs or not remains a user choice.
