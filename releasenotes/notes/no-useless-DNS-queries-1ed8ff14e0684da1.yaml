# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    In order to avoid useless DNS queries, the agent now uses FQDN when connecting to datadog intakes.
    Concretely, it adds a trailing dot at the end of the datadog intake hostnames.
    While this change should be transparent to most users, it can have an impact when the agent is deployed on intrusive setups where the connections between the agent and the datadog intakes are intercepted by a proxy or a firewall that is doing deep packet inspection or TLS man-in-the-middle.
    Users that have such a proxy or L7 firewall should ensure that the rules for agent connections to ``*.datadoghq.com`` hosts are also valid for connections to ``*.datadoghq.com.`` (with an additional trailing dot) hosts.

    Use FQDNs when the Agent builds intake hostnames with ``DD_SITE`` to prevent generating as many DNS queries as there are entries in the ``search`` section of the ``/etc/resolv.conf` file.
    If an intake full URL is explicitly set with a ``dd_url`` parameter, then, the parameter is used as-is and using FQDNs or not remains a user choice.
