# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    In order to avoid unnecessary DNS queries, the agent now uses FQDN when connecting to Datadog intakes.
    Specifically, it adds a trailing dot at the end of the Datadog intake hostnames.
    While most users may not notice this change, it can affect setups where connections between the agent and Datadog intakes are intercepted for deep packet inspection or TLS man-in-the-middle by proxies or firewalls.
    Users that have such a proxy or L7 firewall should ensure that the rules for agent connections to ``*.datadoghq.com`` hosts are also valid for connections to ``*.datadoghq.com.`` (with an additional trailing dot) hosts.

    Use FQDNs when the Agent builds intake hostnames with ``DD_SITE`` to prevent generating as many DNS queries as there are entries in the ``search`` section of the ``/etc/resolv.conf` file.
    If an intake full URL is explicitly set with a ``dd_url`` parameter, then, the parameter is used as-is and using FQDNs or not remains a user choice.
