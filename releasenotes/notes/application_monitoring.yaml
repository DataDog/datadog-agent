# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Introduce a new sample configuration file, `application_monitoring.yaml`, to support the Hands Off config feature.
    This file is automatically placed under `/etc/datadog-agent/` on Linux systems only. Users can manually edit the
    file to apply application monitoring configurations.
