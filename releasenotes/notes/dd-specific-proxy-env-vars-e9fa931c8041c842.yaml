    Proxy settings can be configured through the environment variables ``DD_PROXY_HTTP``,
    ``DD_PROXY_HTTPS`` and ``DD_PROXY_NO_PROXY``. These environment variables take precedence over
    the ``proxy`` options configured in ``datadog.yaml``, and behave exactly the same way as these
    options. The standard ``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY`` and ``NO_PROXY`` are still honored but have
    known side effects on integrations, for simplicity we recommended using the new environment variables.
    For more information, please refer to our `proxy docs`_

upgrade:
  - |
    If the environment variables that can be used to configure a proxy (``DD_PROXY_HTTP``, ``DD_PROXY_HTTPS``,
    ``DD_PROXY_NO_PROXY``, ``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY`` and ``NO_PROXY``) are present with an empty value
    (e.g. ``HTTP_PROXY=""``), the Agent now uses this empty value instead of ignoring it and using
    lower-precedence options.
