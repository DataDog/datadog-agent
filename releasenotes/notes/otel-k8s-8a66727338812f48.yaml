# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The OTEL logs agent exporter now supports exporting Kubernetes orchestrator data. 
    The exporter consumes Kubernetes resource manifests from the ``k8sobjectsreceiver``
    and forwards them to Datadog's orchestrator endpoint. This enables Kubernetes cluster
    visibility through the OTEL agent pipeline. 
    
    Use the ``OrchestratorConfig`` section to configure
    cluster name, API key, site, endpoint, and enablement toggle.
