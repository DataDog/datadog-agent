# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Add initial support for converting trace payload formats to the new "v1.0" format. This feature is disabled by default
    but can be enabled by adding the feature flag "convert-traces" to apm_config.features. It is not recommended to use this flag
    without direction from Datadog Support.
