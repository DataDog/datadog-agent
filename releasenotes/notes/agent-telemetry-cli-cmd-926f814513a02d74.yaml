# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add ability to show Agent telemetry payloads to be sent by Agent
    if the telemetry is enabled. One can run it with the following command:
       `agent diagnose show-metadata agent-telemetry`. See
    `docs <https://docs.datadoghq.com/data_security/agent/#telemetry-collection>` for more details.
