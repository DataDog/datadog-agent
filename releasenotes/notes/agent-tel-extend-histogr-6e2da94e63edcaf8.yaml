# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Extended Agent telemetry histogram details, specifically:
      - Added previously omitted and implicit `+Inf` bucket value to histogram payload.
      - Added p75, p95, and p99 histogram values (expressed as the upper-bound for the
        matching bucket).
