# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add `ignore_autodiscovery_tags` parameter config check.

    In some cases, a check should not receive tags coming from the autodiscovery listeners.
    By default `ignore_autodiscovery_tags` is set to false which doesn't change the behavior of the checks.
    The first check that will use it is `kubernetes_state`.
