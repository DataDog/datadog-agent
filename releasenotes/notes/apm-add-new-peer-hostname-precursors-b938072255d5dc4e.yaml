# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    For the [Inferred Service Dependencies beta](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/guide/inferred-service-opt-in/?tab=java), add two new `peer.hostname` precursor attributes: `out.host` and `dns.hostname`. This will improve coverage of inferred services which come from some tracer integrations which only place the peer hostname in one of those attributes.
