# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Upgrade notes should be rare: only list known/potential breaking changes,
    or major behaviorial changes that require user action before the upgrade.
    Notes here must include steps that users can follow to 1. know if they're
    affected and 2. handle the change gracefully on their end.

enhancements:

    Added a new config flag `process_config.cache_lookupid`. This is an optional flag caches calls to `user.LookupId` in the process agent.
    Some users have reported a leak here, so this flag can be used to minimize the number of calls to `user.LookupId`.
