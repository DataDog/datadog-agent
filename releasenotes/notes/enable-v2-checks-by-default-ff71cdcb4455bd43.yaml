# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Enable the Go disk and network core checks by default for Windows and Linux.
    These are direct ports of the existing Python disk and network checks and allow
    the Python runtime to be lazy loaded when other integrations are enabled. It
    can be disabled with setting ``use_diskv2_check`` and ``use_networkv2_check``
    respectively along with the loader in your configuration to use the Python
    version.
