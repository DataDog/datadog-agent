features:
  - Logs-agent now runs as a goroutine in the main agent process
  - All docker event subscribers are multiplexed in one connection, reduces stress on the docker daemon
  - The Agent can find relevant listeners on its host by using the "auto" listener, for now only docker is supported
fixes:
  - "[logs] Fix an issue when the hostname was not provided in datadog.yaml: the logs-agent logic uses the same hostname as the main agent"
  - "[logs] Trim spaces from single lines"
  - Fix missing fields in forwarder logging entries
  - Fix RancherOS cgroup mountpoint detection
  - "[linux packaging] Fix missing dd-agent script after upgrade, the fix will take effect on a fresh install of '>= beta.8' or upgrade from '>= beta.8'"
  - "[logs] Do not send empty logs with multilines"
  - "[flare] Fix command on Windows by fixing path of collected log files"
other:
  - Remove resversion handling from podwatcher, as it's unused
