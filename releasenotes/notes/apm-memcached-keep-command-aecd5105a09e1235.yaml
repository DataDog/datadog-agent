# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: The Agent now obfuscates the entire Memcached command by
    default. You can revert to the previous behavior where only the values
    were obfuscated by setting ``DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_MEMCACHED_KEEP_COMMAND=true``
    or ``apm_config.obfuscation.memcached.keep_command: true`` in datadog.yaml.
