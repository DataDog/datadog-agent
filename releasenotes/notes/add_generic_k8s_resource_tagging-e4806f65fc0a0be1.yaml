# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added capability to tag any Kubernetes resource based on labels and annotations.
    This feature can be configured with `kubernetes_resources_annotations_as_tags` and `kubernetes_resources_labels_as_tags`.
    These feature configurations are associate group resources with annotations-to-tags (or labels-to-tags) map
    For example, `pods` can be associated with an annotations-to-tags map to configure annotations as tags for pods.
    Example:
    {`pods`: {`annotationKey1`: `tag1`, `annotationKey2`: `tag2`}}
