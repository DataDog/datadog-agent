# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The metrics reported by KSM core now include the tags "kube_app_name",
    "kube_app_instance", and so on, if they're related to a Kubernetes entity
    that has a standard label like "app.kubernetes.io/name",
    "app.kubernetes.io/instance", etc.
