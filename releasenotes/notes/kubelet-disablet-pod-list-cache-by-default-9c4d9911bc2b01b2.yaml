# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The kubelet pod list cache is now disabled by default to reduce staleness.

    ``kubelet_cache_pods_duration`` retain their existing behavior (the Agent
    lists pods approximately every 5 + cache duration seconds).
