# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Docker container, when not running in a Kubernetes
    environment may now be tailed from their log file.
    The Agent must have read access to /var/lib/docker/containers
    and Docker containers must use the JSON logging driver.
    This new option can be activated using the new configuration
    flag ``logs_config.docker_container_use_file``.
