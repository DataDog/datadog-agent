# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Python runtime is now loaded when the first check is loaded, rather than when the agent starts.
    This will eventually avoid having to load Python when no Python check is enabled.
    This change can be reverted by setting ``python_lazy_loading: false`` in your configuration.
