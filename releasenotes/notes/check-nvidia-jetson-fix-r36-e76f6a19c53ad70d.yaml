# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix the NVIDIA Jetson check to support parsing the ``tegrastats`` output 
    when there are multiple Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs). In that case, the metric 
    ``nvidia.jetson.gpu.freq`` is emitted for each GPC and tagged with ``gpc:0``, ``gpc:1``, and so on.
