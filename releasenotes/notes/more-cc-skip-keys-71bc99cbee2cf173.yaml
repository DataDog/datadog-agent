# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Add tags `databricks_job_id`, `databricks_job_run_id`, `databricks_task_run_id`, `config.spark_app_startTime`, `config.spark_databricks_job_parentRunId`
    to the default list of tags that are known to not be credit card numbers so they are skipped by the credit card obfuscator.
