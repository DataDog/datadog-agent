# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    OTLP ingest for traces now supports stable (v1.23.0+) semantic conventions for HTTP Spans.
    Old (v1.20.0 and older) semantic conventions are still supported. When both are reported,
    the new semantic conventions take precedence and old semantic conventions are ignored.
