    The Agent now sends its configuration to Datadog by default to be displayed in the `Agent Configuration` section of
    the host detail panel. See https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/list/#agent-configuration for more information.
    The Agent configuration is scrubbed of any sensitive information and only contains configuration youâ€™ve set using
    the configuration file or environment variables.
    To disable this feature set `inventories_configuration_enabled` to `false`.
