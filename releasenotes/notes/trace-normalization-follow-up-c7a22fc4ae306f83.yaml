# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    For trace normalization, use clearer default names `unnamed-service` and `unnamed-operation` instead of previously
    confusing names `service` and `service.trace`. Missing start date now defaults to `now - duration` which is more
    reasonable than simply `now`.
