enhancements:
  - |
    Add `logs_config.use_container_timestamp` to optionally use the `time` field from container log files as the log timestamp instead of ingestion time.
fixes:
  - |
    When `logs_config.use_container_timestamp` is enabled, prevent multiple log lines from being assigned identical ingestion timestamps and preserve the `time` field provided in container log files.
