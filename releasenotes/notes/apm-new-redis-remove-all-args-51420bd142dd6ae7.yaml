# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Added support for obfuscating all Redis command arguments. For any Redis
    command, all arguments will be replaced by a single "?". Configurable using 
    config variable ``apm_config.obfuscation.redis.remove_all_args`` and 
    environment variable ``DD_APM_OBFUSCATION_REDIS_REMOVE_ALL_ARGS``.
    Both accept a boolean value with default value ``false``.
