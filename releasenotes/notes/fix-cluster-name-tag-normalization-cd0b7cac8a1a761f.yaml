# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    Introduce a new option `enabled_rfc1123_compliant_cluster_name_tag`
    that enforces the `kube_cluster_name` tag value to be
    an RFC1123 compliant cluster name. It can be disabled by setting this
    new option to `false`.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix the `kubernetes_state_core` check so that the host alias name
    creation uses a normalized (RFC1123 compliant) cluster name.
