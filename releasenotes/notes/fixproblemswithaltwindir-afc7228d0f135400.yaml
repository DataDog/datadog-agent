# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

fixes:

    On Windows, further fixes when installation drive isn't c:.  Fixes
    problem where `logs` was effectively hardcoded to use `c:` for programdata
    Fixes installation problem where process & trace service were using
    `c:\programdata\...` to find datadog.yaml regardless of installation dir

    If upgrading from a prior version, the configuration file (datadog.yaml) may 
    have incorrect data.  It will be necessary to manually update those entries.
    For example
    `confd_path: c:\programdata\datadog\conf.d`
    will have to be changed to
    `confd_path: d:\programdata\datadog\conf.d`
    etc.
