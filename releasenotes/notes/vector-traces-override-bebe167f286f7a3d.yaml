# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Add two options under the `vector` config prefix to send traces
    to Vector instead of Datadog. Set `vector.traces.enabled` to true.
    Set `vector.traces.url` to point to a Vector endpoint. This overrides 
    the main endpoint. Additional endpoints remains fully functional.
