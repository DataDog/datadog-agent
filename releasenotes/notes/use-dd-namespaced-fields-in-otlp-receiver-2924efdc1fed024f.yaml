# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Adds the functionality to construct a DD span from datadog. attributes on an incoming span. By default, look for a span attribute starting with datadog.; if it's present, it's used to compute the corresponding datadog field (e.g., datadog.service is used to set ddspan.Service). It will override other sources of the same field (e.g., if both datadog.service and service.name are present, datadog.service is used).
    By default, if a field is missing, it will be recomputed (e.g., if there's no datadog.env, look for env in deployment.environment). However, if the config option otlp_config.traces.ignore_missing_datadog_fields is specified, then the field will not be recomputed. This option is given so that users can explicitly specify blank fields if they like (e.g. specify that datadog.env = "").

    The following functionality is removed: if both http.response.status_code and http.status_code are present in the span attributes, the former was preferred over the latter. Similarly, http.request.method was preferred over http.method. In this release, whichever key is encountered first is used.
