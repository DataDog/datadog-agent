    Default logs-agent to use HTTPS with compression when possible.
    Starting from this version, the default transport is HTTPS with compression instead of TCP.
    The usage of TCP is kept in the following cases:
      * logs_config.use_tcp is set to true
      * logs_config.socks5_proxy_address is set, because socks5 proxies are not yet supported in HTTPS with compression
      * HTTPS connectivity test has failed: at agent startup, an HTTPS test request is sent to determine if HTTPS can be used
    
    To force the use of TCP or HTTPS with compression, logs_config.use_tcp or logs_config.use_http can be set to true, respectively.
