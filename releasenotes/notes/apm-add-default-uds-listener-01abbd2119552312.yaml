# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    APM: Add default UDS listeners for traces (trace-agent) and
    dogstatsd (core-agent) on /var/run/datadog/apm.socket and
    /var/run/datadog/dsd.socket, respectively.
    These are used in the Single Step APM Instrumentation, improving
    the onboarding experience and minimizing the agent configuration.
