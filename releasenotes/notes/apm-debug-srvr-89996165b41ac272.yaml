    APM:
      - Run the /debug/* endpoints in a separate server: it uses port 5012 by default and only listens on ``127.0.0.1``. Port is configurable via ``apm_config.debug_server.port`` and ``DD_APM_DEBUG_SERVER_PORT``, set it to 0 to disable the server.
      - Scrub the content served by the expvar endpoint.
