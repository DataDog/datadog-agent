    The Windows Installer NPM feature option, used in ``ADDLOCAL=NPM`` and ``REMOVE=NPM``, no
    longer controls the install state of NPM components. The NPM components are now always
    installed, but will only run when enabled in the agent configuration. The Windows Installer
    NPM feature option still exists for backwards compatability purposes, but has no effect.
