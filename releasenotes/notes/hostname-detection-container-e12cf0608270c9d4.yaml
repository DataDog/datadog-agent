    Starting Agent 7.40, the Agent will fail to start when unable to determine hostname instead of silently using unrelevant hostname (usually, a container id).
    Hostname resolution is key to many features and failure to determine hostname means that the Agent is not configured properly.
    This change mostly affects Agents running in containerized environments as we cannot rely on OS hostname.
