# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    When a pod was annotated with ``prometheus.io/scrape: true``, the Agent used to schedule one ``openmetrics`` check per container in the pod unless a ``datadog.prometheusScrape.additionalConfigs[].autodiscovery.kubernetes_container_names`` list was defined, which restricted the potential container targets.
    The Agent is now able to leverage the ``prometheus.io/port`` annotation to schedule an ``openmetrics`` check only on the container of the pod that declares that port in its spec.
