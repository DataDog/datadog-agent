    Python interpreter ``sys.executable`` is now set to the appropriate interpreter's
    executable path. This should allow ``multiprocessing`` to be able to spawn new
    processes since it will try to invoke the Python interpreter instead of the Agent
    itself. It should be noted though that the Pyton packages injected at runtime by
    the Agent are only available from the main process, not from any sub-processes.
