# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    With this release, ``remote_config.enabled`` is set to ``true`` by default in the Agent configuration file.
    This causes the Agent to request configuration updates from the Datadog site.

    To receive configurations from Datadog, you still need to enable Remote Configuration at the organization level and enable Remote Configuration capability on your API Key from the Datadog application.
    If you don't want the Agent to request configurations from Datadog, set ``remote_config.enabled`` to ``false`` in the Agent configuration file.
