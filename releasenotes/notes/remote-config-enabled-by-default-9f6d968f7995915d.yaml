# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    With this release, remote_config.enabled is set to true by default in the agent configuration file.
    This will cause the agent to request configuration updates from the Datadog site.

    To receive configurations from Datadog, you still need to enable Remote Configuration at the organization level and enable Remote Configuration capability on your API Key from the Datadog UI.
    If you don't want your agent requesting configurations from Datadog, you can set ``remote_config.enabled`` to ``false`` in the agent configuration file.
