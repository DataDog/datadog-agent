# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The ``logs_config.cca_in_ad`` feature flag now defaults to true.  This
    selects updated codepaths in Autodiscovery and the Logs Agent.  No behavior
    change is expected.  Please report any behavior that is "fixed" by setting
    this flag to false.
