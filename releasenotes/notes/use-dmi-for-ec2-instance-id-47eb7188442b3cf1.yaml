    The Agent now leverages DMI information on Unix to get the instance ID on AWS EC2 when the metadata endpoint fails or
    is not accessible. The instance ID is exposed throught DMI only on AWS Nitro instances.
    This will not change the hostname of the Agent upon upgrading, but will add to the list of host aliases.
