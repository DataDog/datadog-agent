# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Agents are now built with Go 1.18.6.  This version of Go brings `changes to
    the garbage collection runtime <https://go.dev/doc/go1.18#runtime>`_ that
    may change the Agent's memory usage.  In internal testing, the RSS of Agent
    processes showed a minor increase of a few MiB, while CPU usage remained
    consistent.  Reducing the value of ``GOGC`` as described in the Go
    documentation was effective in reducing the memory usage at a modest cost
    in CPU usage.
