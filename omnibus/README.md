datadog-agent Omnibus project
=============================
This project creates full-stack platform-specific packages for
`datadog-agent`!

Installation
------------
You must have a sane Ruby 2.0.0+ environment with Bundler installed. Ensure all
the required gems are installed:

```shell
$ bundle install --binstubs
```

Usage
-----
### Build

You create a platform-specific package using the `build project` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus build datadog-agent6
```

The platform/architecture type of the package created will match the platform
where the `build project` command is invoked. For example, running this command
on a MacBook Pro will generate a Mac OS X package. After the build completes
packages will be available in the `pkg/` folder.

### Clean

You can clean up all temporary files generated during the build process with
the `clean` command:

```shell
$ omnibus clean datadog-agent6
```

Adding the `--purge` purge option removes __ALL__ files generated during the
build including the project install directory (`/opt/datadog-agent6`) and
the package cache directory (`/var/cache/omnibus/pkg`):

```shell
$ omnibus clean datadog-agent6 --purge
```

### Publish

Omnibus has a built-in mechanism for releasing to a variety of "backends", such
as Amazon S3. You must set the proper credentials in your `omnibus.rb` config
file or specify them via the command line.

```shell
$ omnibus publish path/to/*.deb --backend s3
```

### Help

Full help for the Omnibus command line interface can be accessed with the
`help` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus help
```

Version Manifest
----------------

Git-based software definitions may specify branches as their
default_version. In this case, the exact git revision to use will be
determined at build-time unless a project override (see below) or
external version manifest is used.  To generate a version manifest use
the `omnibus manifest` command:

```
omnibus manifest PROJECT -l warn
```

This will output a JSON-formatted manifest containing the resolved
version of every software definition.
