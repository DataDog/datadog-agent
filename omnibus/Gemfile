# Pinning libyajl2 to our custom version (see https://github.com/StackVista/libyajl2-gem/tree/1.2.0-fixed-lssp)
# We use the gem that is checked in into vendor/cache because git-based pinning does not work
# Pinning using git is not picked up by transitive dependencies, the only real solution is to provide a properly packaged
# gem, which is the easiest by having it in vendor/cache

# Sadly, DataDog does not provide tag for release we are using, so we are forced to use commit SHA1.
