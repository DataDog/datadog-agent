dependency 'datadog-dogstatsd'

# this dependency puts few files out of the omnibus install dir and move them
# in the final destination. This way such files will be listed in the packages
# manifest and owned by the package manager. This is the only point in the build
# process where we operate outside the omnibus install dir, thus the need of
# the `extra_package_file` directive.
# This must be the last dependency in the project.
