# The location that the bulk of the agent gets installed to. Like most *nix tools, this

# Migration to bazel warning:
# The goal we are aiming for is that output base is always passed to build
# scripts and we install artifacts to output_base + install_dir. Unfortunately,
# many existing scripts only use install_dir, without regard to a a base. They
# put etc files under opt/datadog, then move them to /etc in the final part of the
# build.
# TODO: We need to learn how people expect to use install dir to create custom
# builds for local testing that do not wipe out their local installation.

# the path prepended to /etc to get a safe place to write.
# We can set this from the omnibus variable OUTPUT_CONFIG_DIR.
# But, it seems to be empty in CI runs, so we end up writing to /.
# The default is /tmp so we don't shoot our feet off in local testing.
# If we end up keeping this flag, let's give it a better name and
# git it a better value.
