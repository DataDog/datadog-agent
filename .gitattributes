# Fix `git diff` when running on the below file formats.
# Our windows build image uses MinGit which tries to use the astextplain diff algorithm (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_setting_the_internal_diff_algorithm).
# The astextplain binary is not embedded in the docker image making the git diff command fail when one of the below file formats is in the diff.
# The error is:
# ```
# error: cannot spawn astexplain: No such files or directory
# fatal: unable to read files diff
# ```
# We're overriding the MinGit default gitattributes config to avoid using astextplain on the file formats below.
# The MinGit's gitconfig file still have the problematic config though it should not use it anymore:
# ```
# [diff "astextplain"]
#	textconv = astextplain
# ```
