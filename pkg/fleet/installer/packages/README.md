# Package installation hooks

All the packaging tools we use (`dpkg`, `rpm`, the `installer`) allow package-specific code to execute at various stages of the package lifecycle.

## Regular installation / removal / upgrade

The following is valid for `deb`, `rpm`, and `oci` packages.

1. v1's `PreRemove` hook is executed. Note that we inform the hook that the package is being upgraded.
2. v2's files are written to disk and v1's files are removed.
3. v2's `PostInstall` hook is executed. Note that we inform the hook that the package is being upgraded.

## Experiment upgrades

The following is only valid for `oci` packages.

The installer supports a safer upgrade path for `oci` packages called "experiments".
