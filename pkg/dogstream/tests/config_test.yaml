init_config:
  # the check will refresh the matching pid list every X seconds
  # except if it detects a change before. You might want to set it
  # low if you want to alert on process service checks.
  # pid_cache_duration: 120
  #
  # used to override the default procfs path, e.g. for docker containers with the outside fs mounted at /host/proc
  # procfs_path: /proc

instances:
# The `system.processes.cpu.pct` metric sent by this check is only accurate for processes that live
# for more than 30 seconds. Do not expect its value to be accurate for shorter-lived processes.
#
#  - name: (required) STRING. It will be used to uniquely identify your metrics as they will be tagged with this name
#    search_string: (required) LIST OF STRINGS. If one of the elements in the list matches,
#                    return the counter of all the processes that contain the string
#    exact_match: (optional) Boolean. Default to True, if you want to look for an arbitrary
#                 string, use exact_match: False
#    ignore_denied_access: (optional) Boolean. Default to True, when getting the number of files descriptors, dd-agent user might
#    get a denied access. Set this to true to not issue a warning if that happens.
#    thresholds: (optional) Two ranges: critical and warning
#         warning: (optional) List of two values: If the number of processes found is below the first value or
#                  above the second one, the process check will return WARNING.
#         critical: (optional) List of two values: If the number of processes found is below the first value or
#                   above the second one, the process check will return CRITICAL.
#     In this example, process check will return OK for 3 to 5 process. WARNING for 1, 2, 6, 7 processes and Critical below 1 or above 7.
#     CRITICAL is always dominant in case of overlapping.
