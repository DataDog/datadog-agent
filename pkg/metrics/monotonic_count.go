// MonotonicCount tracks a raw counter, based on increasing counter values.
// Samples that have a lower value than the previous sample are ignored (since it usually
// means that the underlying raw counter has been reset).
// Example:
//  submitting samples 2, 3, 6, 7 returns 5 (i.e. 7-2) on flush ;
//  then submitting samples 10, 11 on the same MonotonicCount returns 4 (i.e. 11-7) on flush

	// With flushFirstValue enabled (passed in MetricSample), these 2 differences apply:
	// 1. the sampled value will be flushed as-is if it's the first value sampled (and no other
	//    values are flushed until the flush). The assumption is that the underlying raw counter
	//    started from 0 and that any earlier value of the raw counter would'be been sampled
	//    earlier, so it's safe to flush the raw value as-is.
	// 2. a sample that has a lower value than the previous sample is not ignored, instead its
	//    value is used as the value to flush. The assumption is that the underlying raw counter was
	//    reset from 0.
	// This flag is used (for example) by the openmetrics check after its first run, to better
	// support openmetrics monotonic counters.
