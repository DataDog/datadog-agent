## gRPC: Protobuf and Gateway code generation 

To generate the code for the API you have defined in your `.proto`
files we will need three different grpc-related packages: 

- protobuf - protoc-gen-go: generates the golang protobuf definitions.
- grpc-gateway - protoc-gen-grpc-gateway: generates the gRPC-REST gateway  
- grpc-gateway - protoc-gen-swagger (optional)

### Install

From the repository root run the following:
```
inv install-tools
```
This should drop all required binaries in your `$GOPATH/bin`

Remember to make sure `GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`, also make
sure no other versions of those binaries you may have installed
elsewhere take precedence (`which` is your friend).

### Code Generation

From the repository root run the following:

```
inv generate-protobuf
```

Those two will generate the protobuf golang definitions _and_ the
gRPC gateway code that will allow us to serve the API also as a 
REST application.


### Compiling the Agent

Remember to make sure your gRPC go dependencies are current for
the agent by running:
```
inv -e deps
```

The grpc deps are defined [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/cmd/agent/api/tools.go)
and are tracked by gomod.


### Notes

We are currently pinned to fairly old versions for some of the 
protobuf/grpc dependencies and tooling. These are required as a
consequence of third-party libraries (most notably etcd). Please
see `go.mod` and `internal/tools/proto/go.mod` to understand the
version requirements. 

The tooling in place should help our protobuf versions be consistent
across the board.
