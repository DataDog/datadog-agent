// Package pb contains the data structures used by the trace agent to communicate
// with tracers and the Datadog API. Note that the "//go:generate" directives from this
// package were removed because the generated files were manually edited to create
// adaptions (see decoder.go).

// TODO: eventually move this to https://github.com/DataDog/agent-payload
