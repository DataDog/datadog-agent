//
// All extracted APM events are then submitted to sampling. This sampling is 2-fold:
// * A first sampling step is done based on the extraction sampling rate returned by an Extractor. If an Extractor
//   returns an event accompanied with a 0.1 extraction rate, then there's a 90% chance that this event will get
//   discarded.
// * A max events per second maxEPSSampler is applied to all non-PriorityUserKeep events that survived the first step
//   and will ensure that, in average, the total rate of events returned by the processor is not bigger than maxEPS.
