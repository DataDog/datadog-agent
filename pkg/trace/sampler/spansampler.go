// ApplySpanSampling searches chunk for spans that have a span sampling tag set.
// If it finds such spans, then it replaces chunk's spans with only those spans,
// and sets the chunk's sampling priority to "user keep." Tracers that wish to
// keep certain spans even when the trace is dropped will set the appropriate
// tags on the spans to be kept.
// Do not call ApplySpanSampling on a chunk that the other samplers have
// decided to keep. Doing so might wrongfully remove spans from a kept trace.
