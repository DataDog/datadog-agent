# Examples:
# exclude all, except containers based on the 'ubuntu' image or the 'debian' image.

# ac_include: ["image:ubuntu", "image:debian"]
#
# include all, except containers based on the 'ubuntu' image.

# The Datadog Cluster Agent is a remote metadata provider to enrich Pod's tags.

# cluster_agent:
#   The Authentication Token used to query the Datadog cluster agent from the node agent.
#   This token length must be greater than 32 characters.
#   If the value of cluster_agent_auth_token is left unset, the agent will fetch the content of

#
#   Cluster agent connectivity
#   The cluster agent is a remote service, you need to provide an endpoint to query it.

#   cluster_agent_url: ""
#
#   If the node-agent runs inside a Kubernetes Pod, you can use a Kubernetes Service to discover the

#   name of the Kubernetes service.
