# Overrides the site setting defined in "site".
# dd_url: https://app.datadoghq.com

# If you need a proxy to connect to the Internet, provide it here (default:
# disabled). You can use the 'no_proxy' list to specify hosts that should
# bypass the proxy. These settings might impact your checks requests, please
# refer to the specific check documentation for more details. Environment

# This option is useful when the native tags do not support repeating multiple

#  With a raw collected tag "foo:1;2;3"
#  Using the following configuration:
#
#    tag_value_split_separator:

# The `check_runners` refers to the number of concurrent check runners available
# for check instance execution. The scheduler will attempt to spread the

# would result in checks running sequentially.
#
# NOTE: due to the nature of the python interpreter and its global interpreter
# lock (GIL) only one native thread may be running on the python interpreter at
# a time. Concurrent check runners imply concurrently executing checks must contend
# for the GIL. This has the side-effect of increasing wall-time execution times for
# the checks. The aggregate system/user-time for all checks however, should be
# decreased. Concurrency works particularly well with I/O bound tasks (or at least
# IO intensive) as the GIL will typically be released while waiting for IO, allowing
# for other checks to grab a hold of the GIL and continue execution. For CPU-bound
# checks with a low activity, it's likely that the check instances will contend for
# the GIL, which will cause a CPU overhead compared to running these check instances
# sequentially (i.e. on one check runner).
#
# This is a sensitive setting and we do NOT recommend changing the default number
