#  Dogstream (log file parser)												 #
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Comma-separated list of logs to parse and optionally custom parsers to use.
# The form should look like this:

#
# Or this:
#
#   dogstreams: /path/to/log1:/path/to/my/parsers_module.py:custom_parser, /path/to/log2, /path/to/log3, ...
#
# Each entry is a path to a log file and optionally a Python module/function pair
# separated by colons.
#
# Custom parsers should take a 2 parameters, a logger object and
# a string parameter of the current line to parse. It should return a tuple of
# the form:
#   (metric (str), timestamp (unix timestamp), value (float), attributes (dict))
# where attributes should at least contain the key 'metric_type', specifying
# whether the given metric is a 'counter' or 'gauge'.
#
# Unless parsers are specified with an absolute path, the modules must exist in
# the Agent's PYTHONPATH. You can set this as an environment variable when
# starting the Agent. If the name of the custom parser function is not passed,
# 'parser' is assumed.
