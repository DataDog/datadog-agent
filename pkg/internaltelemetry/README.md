- The internaltelemetry package

This package is a temporary location for the implementation of being able to log internal
telemetry to the DataDog back end for internal consumption.  The long-term mechanisms
for this are currently being worked out.  In the short term, this is a temporary package
for a limited number of consumers who need to be able to log internal data.
