// which we currently expect to trigger all services to restart. Perhaps we can use an agent command instead of PowerShell
// and it can check for a special exit code from each of the services. However we wouldn't be able to use configuration management

// want to consider calling StartServiceCtrlDispatcher before the go runtime is initialized, for example
// via a C constructor.
