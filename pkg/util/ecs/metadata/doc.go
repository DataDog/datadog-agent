There are three versions of these APIs:

	- V1: also called introspection endpoint.

	- V2: available since ecs-agent 1.17.0 with the EC2 launch type and since
	platform version 1.1.0 with the Fargate launch type.

	- V3: available since ecs-agent 1.21.0 with the EC2 launch type and since
	platform version 1.3.0 with the Faragate launch type.

Each of these versions sits in its own subpackage.
