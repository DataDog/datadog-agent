# This file is used to configure the security-agent required tests.
# It is used to specify the tests that are required to pass for each KMT test runner.
# Tags are used to match the test runner tags, and required_tests are regex patterns for the tests that are required to pass.
# If the tags of a specific config are a subset of the test runner tags then the set of required tests is used as required tests for the runner.
# Multiple runner configs are allowed to match the same test runner tags.
# List of supported tags
#   - test_set (set of tests that the runner runs: cws_host, cws_docker, cws_ad, cws_el, cws_el_ns, cws_req, cws_peds)
#   - arch (architecture of the test runner: x86_64, arm64)
#   - os (operating system of the test runner: ubuntu_24.10, amazon_2023, etc.)
