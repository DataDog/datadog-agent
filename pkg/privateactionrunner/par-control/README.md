# par-control

`par-control` is the control-plane process for the Private Action Runner in split mode.
It runs under `dd-procmgrd` and owns the lifecycle of the on-demand executor.

`par-control` runs only when both `private_action_runner.enabled` and `private_action_runner.split_enabled` are true. These are disabled by default for now.

See this [RFC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VS1aI_rKRSfx9qx-bZaHJKRq8_oZdtXL9dLda93_Gmo) for details.
