# par-control

`par-control` is the control-plane process for the Private Action Runner in split mode.
It runs under `dd-procmgrd` and owns the lifecycle of the on-demand executor.

`par-control` runs only when both `private_action_runner.enabled` and `private_action_runner.split_enabled` are true. These are disabled by default for now.

See this [RFC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VS1aI_rKRSfx9qx-bZaHJKRq8_oZdtXL9dLda93_Gmo) for details.

## Configuration

Go owns configuration and enrollment. At startup, `par-control` runs the command
passed to `--bootstrap-command` and reads its resolved JSON from a private
temporary file. Stdout and stderr remain logs. The payload may contain credentials,
so it is never logged or included in errors.

## Build and test

The crate is Linux/Windows-only. On macOS, use the Linux dev VM to run commands and tests:

```bash
dda env dev run -- bazel test //pkg/privateactionrunner/par-control:par-control_test
```

On Linux:

```bash
bazel test //pkg/privateactionrunner/par-control:par-control_test
bazel build //pkg/privateactionrunner/par-control:par-control
```
