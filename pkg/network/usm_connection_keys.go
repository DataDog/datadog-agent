// this file is here because Windows has its own ConnectionKeysFromConnectionStats.
// however, putting this in `_linux.go` broke the mac build ?

// ConnectionKeysFromConnectionStats constructs connection key using the underlying raw connection stats object, which is produced by the tracer.
// Each ConnectionStats object contains both the source and destination addresses, as well as an IPTranslation object that stores the original addresses in the event that the connection is NAT'd.
// This function generates all relevant combinations of connection keys: [(source, dest), (dest, source), (NAT'd source, NAT'd dest), (NAT'd dest, NAT'd source)].
// This is necessary to handle all possible scenarios for connections originating from the USM module (i.e., whether they are NAT'd or not, and whether they use TLS).
