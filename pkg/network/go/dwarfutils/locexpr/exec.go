	// Execute the location expression to find the offset and pieces.
	// Note: there are two slight complexities to how this could work.
	// First, a location expression could depend on the value
	// of the canonical frame address (CFA) at the current program counter
	// (by using the expression opcode `DW_OP_call_frame_cfa`,
	// which would pull in the value from `op.DwarfRegisters.CFA`),
	// which is determined using the Call frame information section.
	// However, this is would add significant complexity to this implementation,
	// so we make the assumption that the CFA is constant
	// upon the entry to the function,
	// and that it is equal to/at a constant offset to the current stack pointer.
	// However, because we're executing these programs in a static context,
	// we don't have an actual value for the CFA,
	// so instead we inject an arbitrary large value
	// that lets us detect if it was indeed used to determine the offset,
	// and if so, subtract the original CFA value to get the stack pointer offset.
	// Second, a location expression could depend on the frame base of the function
	// (by using the expression op `DW_OP_fbreg [offset]`,
	// which would pull in the value from `op.DwarfRegisters.FrameBase` and add the offset),
	// which is stored in the `DW_AT_frame_base` attribute on the function DIE.
	// However, because this can also be a DWARF expression,
	// we again make some assumptions to simplify the implementation.
	// Just like with the CFA, we inject a large number
	// and subtract it from the final offset if it was used.

	//    assume it was derived from the frame base
	//    (this should reliably work unless the offset is itself derived from the CFA
	//    plus some very large number, which is unlikely)
	// 2. Otherwise, if the offset is greater than the midpoint between the fake CFA and 0,
