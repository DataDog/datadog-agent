	// for the functions we're tracing.

	// - https://github.com/go-delve/delve/pull/2704#issuecomment-944374511

	//
	// When optimizations are enabled, and depending on the Go version,
	// it has been observed that these parameter locations are sometimes missing pieces
	// (either due to them being eliminated on purpose
	// (as in the case of an unused slice length/capacity/data) being omitted)
	// or due to (spooky behavior in the compiler?))
	// or missing entire parameters (again due to (spooky behavior in the compiler?)).
	// This is unfortunate; I don't think there is a clean way to work around this
	// (since the data is just missing).
	// The best solution I have found is to:
	// - manually handle cases where entire parameters are missing
	//   if it's known that they only occur on a specific Go version
	//   (Go 1.16.* is one that I have found to be troublesome)
	//   and insert the appropriate parameter locations if known.
	// - if all of the parameters are missing,
	//   then I have found that manually re-implementing
	//   the stack/register allocation algorithm for function arguments/returns
	//   (depending on the ABI, and using the sizes of the values from the type metadata)
	//   can work to still obtain the parameters at runtime.
	//   This is probably much more brittle
	//   than getting the locations directly from the debug information.

	// then this slice always will be nil/empty.

// Note that while Go only ever passes parameters

// it has been observed that the position metadata emitted by the compiler
// at the function's entrypoint indicates partially-spilled parameters
// that have some pieces still in registers
// and some pieces that have been moved into their reserved space on the stack.
// It's a little unclear whether the location metadata is *correct* in these cases
// (i.e. when attaching an eBPF uprobe at the entrypoint of the function,
// has the first instruction to spill the registers actually been executed?),
// but so far, taking the locations at face value and interpreting them directly
// (specifically handling mixed stack/register locations)
