// Maps skb connection tuple to socket connection tuple.
// On ingress, skb connection tuple is pre NAT, and socket connection tuple is post NAT, and on egress, the opposite.
// We track the lifecycle of socket using tracepoint net/net_dev_queue.
// Some protocol can be classified in a single direction (for example HTTP/2 can be classified only by the first 24 bytes
// sent on the hand shake), and if we have NAT, then the conn tuple we extract from sk_buff will be different than the
// one we extract from the sock object, and then we are not able to correctly classify those protocols.
// To overcome those problems, we save two maps that translates from conn tuple of sk_buff to conn tuple of sock* and vice
// versa (the vice versa is used for cleanup purposes).
