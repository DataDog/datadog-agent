# Cluster check package

This package holds the cluser-agent logic to detect and dispatch cluster checks
on node-agents that report to it. The actual scheduling as delegated to the
node-agents' collector, the cluster-agent is only responsible for spreading
the load across available nodes.

### Handler

The `Handler` class holds the init logic and the glue between components. It has the following
scope:

  - initialise the other classes and register them
  - handle the api calls from the node-agents, read configs and write node statuses
  - watch the leader-election status when configured, and handle the dispatcher's lifecycle accordingly

### dispatcher

The `dispatcher` has the following scope:

  - handle incoming messages (new / removed configs) from the AutoConf system, and
update the store accordingly
  - watch node statuses and de-register stale nodes
  - re-dispatch orphaned configs


## Node-agent communication

The node-agent queries the cluster-agent through the autodiscovery `ClusterChecksConfigProvider`.
