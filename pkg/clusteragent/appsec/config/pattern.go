// InjectionPattern is the main interface to implement to support a new proxy type
// for appsec injection. It is similar to the controller pattern used in
// controller-runtime, but much simpler.
// The controller watches for changes to a specific resource (Resource method)
// and calls the Added, Modified, Deleted methods accordingly.
// The IsInjectionPossible method is called at startup to determine if the pattern
// can be used in the current cluster (e.g. if the required CRDs are present).
// The Namespace method returns the namespace to watch, or metav1.NamespaceAll to watch all namespaces.
// The methods are called sequentially, there is no need to handle concurrency.
// The methods should return an error if something goes wrong, in which case the
// object will be re-queued with a backoff.
