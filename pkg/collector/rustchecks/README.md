# Rust checks

This is the folder where Rust-based checks are located. These Rust projects will be compiled into shared libraries and be loaded as checks by the shared libraries loader.

Note that this folder could be located somewhere else, like in another repository. The Agent doesn't need to have Rust checks in its repository.
