  - ## Data collection
    ##

    # Create events whenever a container status change.
    # Defaults to true.
    #
    # collect_events: false

    # By default we do not collect events with a status ['top', 'exec_start', 'exec_create'].
    # Here can be added additional statuses to be filtered.
    # List of available statuses can be found here https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/#object-types
    # filtered_event_types:
    #    - 'top'
    #    - 'exec_start'
    #    - 'exec_create'

    # Collect disk usage per container with docker.container.size_rw and
    # docker.container.size_rootfs metrics.
    # Warning: This might take time for Docker daemon to generate,
    # ensure that `docker ps -a -q` run fast before enabling it.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_container_size: true

    # Collect images stats
    # Number of available active images and intermediate images as gauges.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_images_stats: true

    # Collect disk usage per image with docker.image.size and docker.image.virtual_size metrics.
    # The check gets this size with the `docker images` command.
    # Requires collect_images_stats to be enabled.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_image_size: true

    # Exclude containers based on their name or image
    # An excluded container will not get any individual container metric reported for it.
    # However it will still appear in the container count since ignoring it here would give
    # a wrong impression about the docker daemon load.
    #
    # How it works: exclude first.
    # If a container matches an exclude rule, it won't be included unless it also matches an include rule.
    #
    # Rules are regexp.
    #
    # Examples:
    # exclude all, except containers based on the 'ubuntu' image or the 'debian' image.
    # exclude: ["image:.*"]
    # include: ["image:ubuntu", "image:debian"]
    #
    # include all, except containers based on the 'ubuntu' image.
    # exclude: ["image:ubuntu"]
    # include: []
    #
    # exclude all debian images except containers with a name starting with 'frontend'.
    # exclude: ["image:debian"]
    # include: ["name:frontend.*"]
    #
    # exclude: []
    # include: []

    # Exclude default pause containers from orchestrators.
    #
    # By default the agent will not monitor kubernetes/openshift pause
    # container. They will still be counted in the container count (just like
    # excluded containers) since ignoring them would give a wrong impression
    # about the docker daemon load.
    #
    # exclude_pause_container: true


    ## Tagging
    ##

    # You can add extra tags to your Docker metrics with the tags list option.
    # Example: ["extra_tag", "env:testing"]
    #
    # tags: []
