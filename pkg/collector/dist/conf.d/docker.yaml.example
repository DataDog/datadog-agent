init_config:
  # Change the root directory to look at to get cgroup statistics. Useful when running inside a
  # container with host directories mounted on a different folder. Default: /.
  # Example for the docker-dd-agent container:
  # docker_root: /host

  # Timeout in seconds for the connection to the docker daemon
  # Default: 5 seconds
  #
  # timeout: 10

  # The version of the API the client will use. Specify 'auto' to use the API version provided by the server.
  # api_version: auto

  # Use TLS encryption while communicating with the Docker API
  #
  # tls: False
  # tls_client_cert: /path/to/client-cert.pem
  # tls_client_key: /path/to/client-key.pem
  # tls_cacert: /path/to/ca.pem
  # tls_verify: True

  # Initialization retries
  #
  # if the agent is expected to start before Docker,
  # use these settings to configure the retry policy.
  #
  # init_retry_interval defines how long (in seconds) the docker client
  # will wait before retrying initialization.
  # Defaults to 0.
  #
  # init_retry_interval: 20
  #
  # init_retries configures how many retries are made before failing permanently.
  # Defaults to 0.
  #
  # init_retries: 5

  - ## Daemon and system configuration
    ##

    # URL of the Docker daemon socket to reach the Docker API. HTTP/HTTPS also works.
    # Warning: if that's a non-local daemon, we won't be able to collect performance metrics.
    #
    url: "unix://var/run/docker.sock"

    ## Data collection
    ##

    # Create events whenever a container status change.
    # Defaults to true.
    #
    # collect_events: false

    # By default we do not collect events with a status ['top', 'exec_start', 'exec_create'].
    # Here can be added additional statuses to be filtered. 
    # List of available statuses can be found here https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/#object-types
    # filtered_event_types:
    #    - 'top'
    #    - 'exec_start'
    #    - 'exec_create'

    # Collect disk usage per container with docker.container.size_rw and
    # docker.container.size_rootfs metrics.
    # Warning: This might take time for Docker daemon to generate,
    # ensure that `docker ps -a -q` run fast before enabling it.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_container_size: true

    # Do you use custom cgroups for this particular instance?
    # Note: enabling this option modifies the way in which we inspect the containers and causes
    #       some overhead - if you run a high volume of containers we may timeout.
    #
    # custom_cgroups: false

    # Report docker container healthcheck events as service checks
    # Note: enabling this option modifies the way in which we inspect the containers and causes
    #       some overhead - if you run a high volume of containers we may timeout.
    #       Container Healthchecks are available starting with docker 1.12, enabling with older
    #       versions will result in an UNKNOWN state for the service check.
    #
    # You must whitelist the containers you wish to submit health service checks for.
    # Use the same mechanism as the tagging system (see Tag:performance_tags section).
    # Example: ["docker_image:tomcat", "container_name:web_front_nginx"]
    #
    # health_service_check_whitelist: []

    # Collect the container count tagged by state (running, paused, exited, dead)
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_container_count: true

    # Collect the volume count for attached and dangling volumes.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_volume_count: true

    # Collect images stats
    # Number of available active images and intermediate images as gauges.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_images_stats: true

    # Collect disk usage per image with docker.image.size and docker.image.virtual_size metrics.
    # The check gets this size with the `docker images` command.
    # Requires collect_images_stats to be enabled.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_image_size: true

    # Collect disk metrics (total, used, free) through the docker info command for data and metadata.
    # This is useful when these values can't be obtained by the disk check.
    # Example: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html
    # Note that it only works when the storage driver is devicemapper.
    # Explanation of these metrics can be found here:
    # https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v1.11.1/daemon/graphdriver/devmapper/README.md
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_disk_stats: true

    # Collect containers exit codes and send service checks critical when exit code is not 0
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_exit_codes: true


    # Exclude containers based on their tags
    # An excluded container will not get any individual container metric reported for it.
    # However it will still appear in the container count since ignoring it here would give
    # a wrong impression about the docker daemon load.
    #
    # The rule is a regex on the tags.
    #
    # How it works: exclude first.
    # If a tag matches an exclude rule, it won't be included unless it also matches an include rule.
    # Examples:
    # exclude all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # exclude: [".*"]
    # include: ["docker_image:ubuntu", "docker_image:debian"]
    #
    # include all, except ubuntu and Kubernetes pause containers.
    # exclude: ["docker_image:ubuntu", "image_name:gcr.io/google_containers/pause.*", "image_name:openshift/origin-pod"]
    # include: []
    #
    # Default: include all containers except for Kubernetes pause containers.
    # Warning: pause containers exclusion works only if you deploy the agent the recommended way (in a pod).
    # To customize this default behavior, override exclude.
    # If you do so, default exclusion patterns won't apply anymore and will need to be added explicitly.



    ## Tagging
    ##

    # You can add extra tags to your Docker metrics with the tags list option.
    # Example: ["extra_tag", "env:testing"]
    #
    # tags: []

    # If the agent is running in an Amazon ECS task, tags container metrics with the ECS task name and version.
    # Default: true
    #
    # ecs_tags: false

    # Custom metrics tagging
    # Define which Docker tags to apply on metrics.
    # Since it impacts the aggregation, modify it carefully (only if you really need it).
    #
    # Tags for performance metrics.
    # Available:
    #   - image_name: Name of the image (example: "nginx")
    #   - image_tag: Tag of the image (example: "latest")
    #   - docker_image: LEGACY. The full image name:tag string (example: "nginx:latest")
    #   - container_name: Name of the container (example: "boring_euclid")
    #   - container_command: Command ran by the container (example: "echo 1")
    #   - container_id: Id of the container
    #
    # performance_tags: ["container_name", "image_name", "image_tag", "docker_image"]

    # Tags for containers count metrics.
    # Available: ["image_name", "image_tag", "docker_image", "container_command"]
    #
    # container_tags: ["image_name", "image_tag", "docker_image"]

    # List of container label names that should be collected and sent as tags.
    # Default to None
    # Example:
    # collect_labels_as_tags: ["com.docker.compose.service", "com.docker.compose.project"]
    # List of docker event attributes to add as tags of the datadog events
    # Defaults to None.
    #
    # event_attributes_as_tags: ["signal"]

    ## Rate Filtering
    ##

    # Allows ad-hoc spike filtering if the system reports incorrect metrics.
    # This will drop points if the computed rate is higher than the cap value
    # capped_metrics:
    #   docker.cpu.user: 1000
    #   docker.cpu.system: 1000
