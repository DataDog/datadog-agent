# The `system.processes.cpu.pct` metric sent by this check is only accurate for processes that live
# for more than 30 seconds. Do not expect its value to be accurate for shorter-lived processes.
#
#  One and only one of search_string, pid or pid_file must be specified
#  - name: (required) STRING. It will be used to uniquely identify your metrics as they will be tagged with this name
#    search_string: LIST OF STRINGS. If one of the elements in the list matches,
#                   return the counter of all the processes that contain the string
#    pid: STRING. A Process id.
#    pid_file: STRING. A Pid file.
#    exact_match: (optional) Boolean. Default to True, if you want to look for an arbitrary
#                 string only use search_string, use exact_match: False
#    ignore_denied_access: (optional) Boolean. Default to True, when getting the number of files descriptors, dd-agent user might
#    get a denied access. Set this to true to not issue a warning if that happens.
#    thresholds: (optional) Two ranges: critical and warning
#         warning: (optional) List of two values: If the number of processes found is below the first value or
#                  above the second one, the process check will return WARNING.
#         critical: (optional) List of two values: If the number of processes found is below the first value or
#                   above the second one, the process check will return CRITICAL.
#     In this example, process check will return OK for 3 to 5 process. WARNING for 1, 2, 6, 7 processes and Critical below 1 or above 7.
#     CRITICAL is always dominant in case of overlapping.
#
# Examples:
#
#  - name: ssh
#    search_string: ['ssh', 'sshd']
#    tags:
#      - env:staging
#      - cluster:big-data
#    thresholds:
#      critical if no sshd or more than 8 sshd are running
#      critical: [1, 7]
#      warning if 1, 2, 6, 7 sshd processes are running
#      warning: [3, 5]
#      ok if 3, 4, 5 processes are running
#
#  - name: postgres
#    search_string: ['postgres']
#    ignore_denied_access: True
#
#  - name: nodeserver
#    search_string: ['node server.js']
#
#  - name: pid_process
#    pid: 1278
#    Do not use search_string when searching by pid or multiple processes will be grabbed
#
#  - name: pid_file
#    pid_file: /var/run/sshd.pid
