# @brief Pool of threads similar to multiprocessing.Pool
# See http://docs.python.org/dev/library/multiprocessing.html
# Differences: added imap_async and imap_unordered_async, and terminate()
# has to be called explicitly (it's not registered by atexit).
#
# The general idea is that we submit works to a workqueue, either as
# single Jobs (one function to call), or JobSequences (batch of
# Jobs). Each Job is associated with an ApplyResult object which has 2
# states: waiting for the Job to complete, or Ready. Instead of
# waiting for the jobs to finish, we wait for their ApplyResult object
# to become ready: an event mechanism is used for that.
# When we apply a function to several arguments in "parallel", we need
# a way to wait for all/part of the Jobs to be processed: that's what
# "collectors" are for; they group and wait for a set of ApplyResult
# objects. Once a collector is ready to be used, we can use a
# CollectorIterator to iterate over the result values it's collecting.
#
# The methods of a Pool object use all these concepts and expose
# them to their caller in a very simple way.
