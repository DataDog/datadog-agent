# Rust checks template

This Rust project can be used as a template for writing Rust checks, it provides everything needed to write custom checks like in Python

## Side notes

As Rust check exact implementations aren't settled yet, `rustcheck` might not be exactly up-to-date with the current implementations of Rust checks.
Check the `httpcheck` Rust project in `pkg/collector/sharedlibrary/httpcheck` to have the most up-to-date version of the base check.
Note that it may have specific dependencies used for this specific check that aren't relevant for the base check.
