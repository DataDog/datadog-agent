  #
  # For each instance, the 'directory' parameter is required, all others are optional.

  # WARNING: Ensure the user account running the Agent (typically dd-agent) has read
  # access to the monitored directory and files.
  #
  # Instances take the following parameters:
  # "directory" - string, the directory to monitor. Required
