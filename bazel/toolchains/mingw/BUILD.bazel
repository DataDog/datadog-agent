# So when you're building a cc_binary, Bazel has all the info it needs to give
# that cc_binary the right toolchain: it knows cc_binary requires a "C++-type
# toolchain" (this is encoded in the cc_binary rule definition) and needs to
# use a toolchain that matches whatever you set --platforms to at the command
