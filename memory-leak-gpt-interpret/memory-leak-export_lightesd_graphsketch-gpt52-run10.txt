PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   - Most anomalies are tightly time-linked across **CPU, memory, IO pressure, smaps memory breakdown, and cgroup lifecycle counters**, suggesting a single short event affecting many metrics at once.  
   - The smaller clusters point to **memory pressure/reclaim activity (pgscan_direct + zswapped)** and a separate **OOM-group-kill co-occurring with hugetlb reservation metric**, consistent with memory contention and possibly an OOM event.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Low.**

5. **Alternative possibilities / why uncertain**  
   - **Instrumentation/collection artifact (very likely):** Many “:count” metrics and some “:avg” show astronomically large outlier scores (and even implausible CPU millicore values), which often happens with counter resets, unit/scale bugs, scrape gaps, or parsing issues rather than real resource events.  
   - **Real short-lived memory pressure event (possible):** The presence of pgscan_direct and zswapped correlation, plus memory pressure/full correlation, could indicate genuine reclaim/swap pressure—but the data shown doesn’t include actual values, only anomaly scores and co-occurrence.  
   - **OOM event in the container (possible):** One cluster directly ties `oom_group_kill` with hugetlb reservation metric, but without the raw counts/values/timestamps around it, it could also be a false positive triggered by counter behavior.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Mass co-anomaly:** `total_anomalies: 7014`, `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 227`, and a huge cluster `graphsketch_cluster_0` containing essentially *all* CPU/memory/smaps metrics (`source_count: 227`).  
   - **Counter-like metrics anomalizing together:** cluster_0 includes many `:count` sources (events, limits, pressures, hugetlb, swap, pids), consistent with a shared scrape/reset/parse issue.  
   - **Implausible/indicative scores:** e.g. `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec:avg (score: 37530000000000)` and `smaps_rollup.private_clean:avg (score: 28160000000000000)`; also `total_cpu_usage_millicores:avg` has wildly varying scores including `190339517081.28`.  
   - **Memory pressure signals (small focused clusters):**  
     - `graphsketch_cluster_2`: `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgscan_direct:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswapped:count` (reclaim + zswap activity).  
     - `graphsketch_cluster_6`: `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg10:count`.  
   - **Possible OOM signal:** `graphsketch_cluster_1`: `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom_group_kill:count ↔ cgroup.v2.hugetlb.2MB.rsvd.max:count` (but could be counter artifact).
