============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All 66 metrics (memory/smaps, CPU usage + throttling + PSI, IO writes, and pids/cgroup counters) shifted together in the same time window, indicating a single container-wide state change/event rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container experienced a sustained step-up in anonymous memory usage (likely a leak or workload phase change) that drove broader resource pressure signals (CPU/PSI/throttling and some IO) concurrently.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Legitimate workload phase change / warmup / cache population:** could explain a step increase across memory, CPU, IO, and pids without being a “bug.”  
   - **Container restart / repopulation event:** cgroup “populated/procs/threads” also anomalied; a restart can cause broad baseline shifts.  
   - **Change in limits/QoS/CPU weight or scheduling conditions:** cpu weight/nice and cpu limit metrics anomalied, which could reflect config change rather than application behavior.  
   Uncertain because the output shows *that* many metrics shifted together, but not the direction/magnitude for most of them nor explicit signals like OOM kills or memory.max hits.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Single correlation cluster: **“Correlated: 66 anomalies in time window”** with **source_count: 66** and only **total_correlations: 1**.  
   - Sustained memory step-up in smaps/cgroup anon metrics:  
     - `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` **18.5M → ~80.3M (6.3σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.pss_anon:avg` **18.5M → ~80.4M (6.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.active_anon:avg` **18.5M → ~80.2–80.5M (6.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon:avg` **18.5M → ~80.3M (6.3σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.rss:avg` **23.4M → ~86.8M (5.7σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.peak:avg` **19.3M → ~81.7M (6.2σ)**  
   - Signs of increased memory-management activity/overhead:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgfault:avg` **6745 → ~22693 (5.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pagetables:avg` **93685 → ~235927 (3.9σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.kernel:avg` **346084 → 700416 (2.8σ)**  
   - Cluster includes broader pressure/resource signals simultaneously: CPU PSI (`cpu.pressure.*`), throttling/usage (`cpu.stat.*`), IO writes (`io.stat.wbytes/wios`), and pids/procs/threads metrics.
