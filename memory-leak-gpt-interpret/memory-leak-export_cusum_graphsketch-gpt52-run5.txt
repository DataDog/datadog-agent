PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all anomalies belong to a single co-occurring cluster (66 metrics) spanning CPU usage/throttling/pressure, memory growth (anon/rss/pss), and some I/O—i.e., one container-level event where CPU and memory behavior shifted together rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container experienced a sustained workload change causing a large increase in CPU (especially kernel/system time) alongside a major rise in anonymous memory/RSS, consistent with a memory-growing process under CPU contention/throttling.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **Alternative possibilities / why uncertain**  
   - **Legitimate scale-up or mode change** (e.g., feature flag, batch job, traffic spike): CUSUM detects sustained shifts, and many shifts are only ~0.6–0.9σ (could be normal but persistent).  
   - **Container restart / different binary or mmap behavior**: big jump in `smaps_rollup.shared_clean` could be a new mapping set (shared libs/page cache) rather than “leak.”  
   - **Resource-limit/setting change**: `cgroup.v2.memory.max` shifted upward, which could mean limits changed (configuration event) and the workload simply used the new headroom.  
   Uncertain because we don’t see direct “OOM kill” events, restart counters, request rate, or a clear monotonic leak pattern—only sustained step changes and co-occurrence.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single dominant correlation group:** `total_correlations: 1`, cluster includes **66 sources**; title indicates strong learned co-occurrence (“freq: 93909.6”).  
   - **CPU step-up:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec` shifted **5112.81 → 64695.17 (3.5σ)**; `system_usec` **2293.39 → 44878.00 (7.8σ)**.  
   - **CPU contention indicators:** anomalies in `nr_throttled`, `throttled_usec`, and CPU pressure metrics; strong edges like `cpu.stat.throttled_usec ↔ memory.stat.file` (freq ~93909.6).  
   - **Memory growth (anon/RSS-like):** `memory.stat.anon` **~6.36MB → ~28.6MB (4.2σ)**; `memory.peak` **~6.9MB → ~29.4MB (3.9σ)**; `memory.stat.active_anon` similarly jumps (~4.2σ).  
   - **Mapping/page-related jump:** `smaps_rollup.shared_clean` **64252 → 4143104 (8.1σ)**.  
   - **Pressure/limits touched:** `cgroup.v2.memory.oom.group` shifted **0.60 → 1.00**; `cgroup.v2.memory.max` shifted **160,259,973 → 268,435,456**.  
   - **Broad co-anomaly edges across CPU+memory+pids:** e.g., `memory.stat.kernel_stack ↔ pids.current` with **17,484 observations** (suggests process/thread/activity change tied to memory behavior).
