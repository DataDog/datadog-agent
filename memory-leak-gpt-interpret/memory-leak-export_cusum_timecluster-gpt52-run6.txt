============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All anomalous metrics (66/66) moved together in one long, single time cluster, meaning this was a container-wide event/shift affecting memory, CPU, I/O, and process-related signals concurrently rather than isolated metric noise.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
A major step increase in the container’s anonymous memory footprint (RSS/PSS/private_dirty/active_anon) consistent with a sudden allocation surge or memory leak onset, with secondary system effects (page faults, kernel/pagetables, and CPU/pressure/throttling changes).

4) **Confidence level**  
**Medium.**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities / uncertainty**  
- **Workload phase change / legitimate load shift:** a new request pattern, feature flag, or batch job could intentionally allocate a lot of anonymous memory and increase CPU/IO at the same time; anomaly detection only says “different from baseline,” not “bad.”  
- **Container restart / repopulation effects:** cgroup “populated/procs/threads/pids” appearing in the same cluster could reflect lifecycle changes that coincide with memory growth.  
- **Measurement/collection artifact:** one massive multi-metric cluster over a long interval can also happen if the “baseline” period isn’t representative (CUSUM trained on first 25%) or if sampling/aggregation changed.  
Uncertainty is mainly because the output shows shifts but not whether memory kept growing, hit limits, caused OOMs, or impacted SLOs.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- Single correlation cluster: **“Correlated: 66 anomalies in time window”** with **source_count: 66**, spanning **first_seen 1768261630 → last_updated 1768262537** (sustained incident window).  
- Large sustained memory shifts (examples):  
  - `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` **18.5M → ~80.3M (6.3σ)**  
  - `smaps_rollup.pss_dirty:avg` **21.3M → ~83.4M (6.1σ)**  
  - `smaps_rollup.rss:avg` **23.4M → ~86.8M (5.7σ)**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.active_anon:avg` **18.5M → ~80.2–80.5M (6.3σ)**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.peak:avg` **19.3M → ~81.7M (6.2σ)**  
- Memory-management side effects increased:  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgfault:avg` **6,745 → ~22,6xx (5.2–5.3σ)**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pagetables:avg` **93,684 → 235,927 (3.9σ)**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.kernel:avg` **346,084 → ~590–700k (2.0–2.8σ)**  
- Cluster includes CPU/pressure/throttling and IO metrics simultaneously (e.g., `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.*throttled*`, `cpu_percentage`, `cgroup.v2.io.stat.wbytes/wios`), consistent with a broad resource-impacting shift rather than a single-metric anomaly.
