============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all detected anomalies across many cgroup v2 CPU/memory/IO/hugetlb/smaps metrics occurred *at the same time* (within the same ~100s window), forming one big “everything changed at once” time cluster—consistent with a single container-level event affecting metric collection or the container’s lifecycle.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: what are the alternative possibilities and why are you uncertain?**  
   - **Metrics pipeline / instrumentation glitch or counter reset**: many `:count` series show absurd outlier scores (e.g., `1e10`), and some `:avg` series show astronomically large scores, which often indicates missing data, NaNs/inf mapped to huge numbers, unit/parse errors, or restarts/reset behavior rather than real resource events.  
   - **Container restart / cgroup recreation**: a restart can cause many cgroup files/values to jump simultaneously (especially `current/peak/events/*` and smaps rollups), producing a large simultaneous cluster without necessarily being an “incident.”  
   - **Real resource incident (CPU + memory pressure, potential reclaim/swap activity)**: kernel CPU anomalies and memory pressure/zswap-related metrics appearing together could be genuine contention, but the extreme scoring on many unrelated `count` metrics makes this less certain.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster**: `total_correlations: 1` with `source_count: 220`, indicating broad simultaneous anomalies rather than a few related signals.  
   - **Tight timing**: cluster `first_seen: 1768261651`, `last_updated: 1768261751` (~100 seconds).  
   - **“Everything” anomalied together**: correlated sources span CPU (`cpu.stat.*`, `cpu.pressure.*`), memory (`memory.current`, `memory.pressure.*`, `memory.events.*`, `memory.stat.*`), IO pressure (`io.pressure.*`), hugetlb, pids, and smaps rollups.  
   - **Suspicious outlier scoring on many `:count` metrics**: e.g. `kernel_cpu_percentage:count (score: 10000000000.00)` and multiple cgroup `:count` metrics with the same huge score at `timestamp 1768261750`.  
   - **Implausibly huge anomaly scores on memory avgs**: `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` scores like `153231360000000000.00` and `2641920000000000.00`, suggestive of data quality/encoding issues.  
   - **Some plausible “real” signal mixed in**: repeated `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg` outliers (scores ~5–6) across nearby timestamps, which could reflect real CPU behavior but is confounded by the mass simultaneous anomalies.
