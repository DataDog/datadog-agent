PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
There is essentially **one dominant correlated event**: when the container’s **thread/process counts and RSS/memory footprint change**, a wide set of **CPU usage/throttling/pressure and memory (anon/file/slab/zswap) metrics** shift together—i.e., a single workload/state transition is driving most anomalies, not many independent issues.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
The container likely experienced a **workload ramp-up (more threads/processes) causing a sustained increase in CPU time (notably system CPU) with CPU throttling and a large rise in anonymous/RSS memory**, consistent with resource pressure (and possibly near-OOM behavior).

4) **Confidence level**  
**Medium.**

5) **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (not high confidence)**  
- **Legitimate scale-up / configuration change** (e.g., new worker pool, higher concurrency, changed memory limit) rather than a fault; CUSUM flags “shift” but not intent.  
- **Metrics/collection artifact or restart/rehydration effects** (e.g., smaps_rollup.shared_clean jumping unusually high) causing widespread correlated “shifts.”  
- **Kernel/page-cache behavior vs app leak**: file/inactive_file and slab shifts could be normal filesystem/cache changes; without time-series context we can’t confirm a leak trend.  
Uncertainty because the output shows *many anomalies* but only *shift magnitudes* and co-occurrence, not duration-to-failure, error rates, OOM kill events, or app-level signals.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single giant cluster:** `total_correlations: 1` with **66 sources** (“graphsketch_cluster_5”), indicating one coupled event affecting most metrics.  
- **CPU ramp + throttling:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec:avg` **5112.81 → 64695.17 (3.5σ)**  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.system_usec:avg` **2293.39 → 44878.00 (7.8σ)**  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.nr_throttled:avg` shifted (sample shows **4.13 → 7.00**)  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.throttled_usec:avg` shifted (**169490.08 → 287080.00**)  
  - CPU pressure metrics are included in the correlated set (`cpu.pressure.*`).  
- **Memory footprint jump (anon/RSS-like):**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon:avg` **~6.36MB → ~28.6MB (4.2σ)** (twice in samples)  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.peak:avg` **~6.9MB → ~29.4MB (3.9σ)**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.active_anon:avg` **~6.36MB → ~28.7MB (4.2σ)**  
  - `smaps_rollup.shared_clean:avg` **64252 → 4143104 (8.1σ)** (large mapping/page-cache-related jump)  
- **Process/thread association:** top edge `kernel_stack ↔ pids.current` (17484 observations) and cluster title references `cgroup.threads ↔ smaps_rollup.rss`.  
- **Potential memory pressure management:** correlated presence of `cgroup.v2.memory.zswap.writeback:avg` and `memory.oom.group:avg` shifting (**0.60 → 1.00**).
