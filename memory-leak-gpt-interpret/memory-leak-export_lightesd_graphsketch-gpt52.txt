PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   - Most anomalies co-occur as one big cluster (227 metrics) spanning CPU, memory, IO pressure, smaps, and many “count”-type cgroup files—suggesting a single underlying event affecting metric collection or cgroup/container lifecycle rather than many independent resource problems.  
   - Smaller clusters point specifically to **memory pressure / reclaim activity** (pgscan_direct ↔ zswapped), **THP/allocator activity** (slab_unreclaimable ↔ thp_collapse_alloc), and **OOM involvement** (hugetlb rsvd.max ↔ oom_group_kill), but they occur in the context of the giant “everything moved” cluster.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Low** (leaning “artifact/instrumentation or container restart/teardown event” over a true multi-resource incident).

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain?**  
   - **Metrics/instrumentation artifact (most likely):** many anomalies are on fields that are effectively configuration/static or sparsely changing “:count” metrics (e.g., cpu.uclamp.*, hugetlb.*.max, pids.max), and the single massive correlation cluster across 227 sources is typical of a scrape/parser/reset issue or reading errors (e.g., missing/zero/NaN/backfilled values) rather than a real workload event. Uncertain because raw metric values (not just scores) aren’t shown.  
   - **Container lifecycle event (restart/kill/cgroup repopulation):** cluster title highlights `cgroup.events.populated` and there’s an anomaly in `nr_dying_descendants`, which can spike during teardown; this could cause many cgroup files to change at once. Uncertain because we don’t see explicit restart timestamps or pod events.  
   - **Real memory pressure culminating in OOM (possible):** explicit correlation between `oom_group_kill` and hugetlb reservation, plus zswap and pgscan_direct correlation; could indicate memory exhaustion/oom. Uncertain because we don’t see `memory.current` vs `memory.max`, sustained PSI, or actual OOM counters increasing (only anomaly flags/scores).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Massive co-anomaly cluster:** `graphsketch_cluster_0` has **227 sources** and very high freq (**87427.5**) spanning CPU stats, PSI, IO stats, memory stats, smaps, pids, etc.  
   - **Container lifecycle hints:** anomalies include `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.populated:count` (in the dominant cluster) and `cgroup.v2.cgroup.stat.nr_dying_descendants:count` (sample anomaly at `1768261668`).  
   - **Possible memory pressure signals:**  
     - `graphsketch_cluster_2`: `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgscan_direct:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswapped:count` (freq **58158.6**)  
     - `graphsketch_cluster_6`: `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg10:count`  
   - **OOM involvement signal:** `graphsketch_cluster_1`: `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.2MB.rsvd.max:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom_group_kill:count` (both anomalous together).  
   - **Suspicious scoring suggesting data issues/out-of-scale values:** sample anomalies show extremely large scores (e.g., `total_cpu_usage_millicores:avg (score: 190339517081.28)`, `smaps_rollup.private_clean:avg (score: 2.816e16)`), consistent with sudden discontinuities/resets rather than gradual resource shifts.
