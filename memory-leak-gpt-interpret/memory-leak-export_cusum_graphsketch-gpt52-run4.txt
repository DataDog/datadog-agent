PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all anomalous metrics (66/66 sources) moved together in one tight cluster, meaning this was a single systemic event affecting CPU, memory (including smaps), I/O, and process/thread counts at the same time rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container experienced a sustained workload step-change that sharply increased CPU (especially system time) and anonymous/RSS memory, leading to CPU throttling/pressure and elevated memory/oom-group-related signals.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Container restart / different process image loaded:** would explain large smaps changes (e.g., shared_clean jump) plus shifts in pids/threads and many metrics moving together; uncertainty because no explicit restart/OOM-kill event is shown.  
   - **Resource limit/constraint change (CPU/memory limits updated):** could cause immediate throttling/pressure and “memory.max” shift; uncertainty because we don’t see the orchestrator action, only the resulting metric shift.  
   - **Host-level contention/noisy neighbor:** could drive CPU pressure + throttling correlations across many signals; uncertainty because data is only for one container and lacks node-wide context.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single dominant correlated cluster:** `total_correlations: 1`, cluster has `source_count: 66` and spans CPU, memory, I/O, pids, smaps.  
   - **CPU step-up + throttling:**  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec` shifted **5112.81 → 64695.17 (3.5σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.system_usec` shifted **2293.39 → 44878.00 (7.8σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.nr_throttled` and `throttled_usec` both shifted (sample anomalies).  
     - Many high-frequency edges among throttling/pressure metrics (e.g., `throttled_usec ↔ memory.stat.file` freq **93909.6**; `pressure.some.total ↔ throttled_usec` freq **93909.6**).  
   - **Memory growth, especially anonymous:**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon` shifted **~6.36MB → ~28.6MB (4.2σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.active_anon` shifted **~6.36MB → ~28.7MB (4.2σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.peak` shifted **~6.9MB → ~29.4MB (3.9σ)**  
   - **smaps shows big mapping/RSS-related change:** `smaps_rollup.shared_clean` shifted **64252 → 4143104 (8.1σ)**.  
   - **Possible limit/policy shift signals:** `cgroup.v2.memory.max` shifted **160,259,973 → 268,435,456**, and `cgroup.v2.memory.oom.group` shifted **0.60 → 1.00**.
