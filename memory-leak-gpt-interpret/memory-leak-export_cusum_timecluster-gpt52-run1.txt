============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All 66 distinct metrics that ever anomalied did so in the same 1‑second time window(s), meaning this looks like a single container-level event/transition that simultaneously shifted memory, CPU, IO, and process/thread signals (one big co-occurring cluster rather than multiple separate issues).

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container experienced a sustained step-change to much higher **anonymous memory/RSS/PSS (likely heap growth/leak or workload phase change)** with associated increases in page faults and kernel memory overhead, coincident with CPU pressure/throttling and some IO activity.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Legitimate workload phase change / warm-up / caching:** a new request type or batch job could legitimately allocate a large anonymous working set; CUSUM flags sustained shifts but doesn’t know intent.  
   - **Container restart / repopulation / scaling event:** cgroup “populated/procs/threads/pids” being in the same cluster could indicate lifecycle changes that shift baselines and trigger many metrics together.  
   - **Instrumentation/baseline artifact:** “normal” is learned from the first 25% only; if that period was unrepresentative (idle), later normal load will look anomalous across many metrics at once.  
   Uncertainty mainly because we don’t see the raw time series shape (e.g., whether memory keeps climbing vs. one-time step) or any explicit OOM/kill indicators.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **One single correlation cluster:** `total_correlations: 1`, cluster includes **66 sources** with `first_seen: 1768261630` and `last_updated: 1768262537`.  
   - **Large sustained anonymous memory jump (~4x):**  
     - `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` **18,479,085 → ~80,328,454** (**6.3σ**)  
     - `smaps_rollup.pss_anon:avg` **18,479,085 → ~80,394,131** (**6.3σ**)  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon:avg` **18,479,296 → ~80,394,131** (**6.3σ**)  
     - `smaps_rollup.rss:avg` **23,439,607 → ~86,842,756** (**5.7σ**)  
   - **Dirty/private memory rises strongly (suggests real allocations, not just file cache):**  
     - `smaps_rollup.private_dirty:avg` **21,298,180 → ~83,599,499** (**6.1σ**)  
     - `smaps_rollup.pss_dirty:avg` **21,298,180 → ~83,424,339** (**6.1σ**)  
   - **More memory management activity/overhead:**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgfault:avg` **6,745 → ~22,692** (**~5.3σ**)  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pagetables:avg` **93,684 → 235,927** (**3.9σ**)  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.kernel:avg` **346,084 → ~700,416** (**2.8σ**)  
   - **Sustained higher memory watermark:** `cgroup.v2.memory.peak:avg` **19,269,797 → 81,666,588** (**6.2σ**)  
   - **CPU pressure/throttling and IO also co-anomalied:** cluster includes `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.*throttled*`, and `cgroup.v2.io.stat.wbytes/wios`, indicating the event wasn’t isolated to a single memory metric.
