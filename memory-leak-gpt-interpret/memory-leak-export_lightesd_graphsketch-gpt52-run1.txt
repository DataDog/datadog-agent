PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Most anomalies are co-occurring across a very large set of CPU, memory, I/O pressure, and smaps metrics at the same time, plus smaller tight pairs that specifically link **memory pressure/scanning & zswap activity**, **memory.current with memory PSI full**, and an **OOM group kill correlated with hugetlb reservation max**—suggesting a container-wide resource/measurement event rather than isolated metric glitches.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Telemetry/math artifact (counter resets / bad rate conversion / scrape glitch):** several “avg” scores are astronomically large (e.g., CPU usage/usec and millicores), which often indicates resets, unit mismatch, or derivative calculation issues rather than real load.  
   - **Container lifecycle event (restart/recreate/cgroup repopulation):** the giant cluster includes `cgroup.events.populated`, `cgroup.procs`, `nr_dying_descendants`, etc., consistent with a brief teardown/rebuild where many counters jump together.  
   - **Real memory-pressure incident with reclaim/zswap and possibly OOM:** smaller clusters point to genuine reclaim and zswap activity and even `oom_group_kill`, but the presence of extreme-value artifacts makes it hard to separate signal from instrumentation noise.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Mass co-anomaly cluster:** `graphsketch_cluster_0` has **227 sources** with very high co-occurrence frequency (**freq 87427.5**) spanning CPU PSI, memory PSI, smaps, io, pids, etc.  
   - **Potential counter/unit anomalies:** sample anomalies show extreme scores:  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec:avg (score: 37530000000000.00)`  
     - `total_cpu_usage_millicores:avg (score: 190339517081.28)`  
     - Multiple metrics with `count` anomalies scored exactly `10000000000.00` (suggesting a sentinel/outlier pattern across many counters).  
   - **Memory reclaim/zswap linkage:** `graphsketch_cluster_2` correlates `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgscan_direct:count` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswapped:count`.  
   - **Memory pressure linkage:** `graphsketch_cluster_6` correlates `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg10:count`.  
   - **OOM-related linkage:** `graphsketch_cluster_1` correlates `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.2MB.rsvd.max:count` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom_group_kill:count`.  
   - **Broad CPU-pressure ties in edges:** many high-observation edges connect `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*` with CPU usage/percent and memory slab/file_dirty, indicating the detector saw them moving anomalously together.
