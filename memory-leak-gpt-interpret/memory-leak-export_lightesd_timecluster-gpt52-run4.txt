PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
There is one incident window (~100s) where a very large number of metrics across CPU, memory, IO pressure, cgroup events, and smaps all anomalied at the same timestamps—i.e., a highly synchronized, container-wide “everything moved” moment rather than isolated metric noise.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A.

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
**Low.**

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain (if not high confidence)**  
- **Metrics pipeline/scrape artifact or counter/reset behavior**: many `:count` series show extreme anomaly scores (often `10000000000.00`) across dozens of unrelated metrics at the exact same time, which is typical of missing data, NaNs coerced to 0, restarts, label churn, or counter resets rather than a real system event.  
- **Container lifecycle event (restart/recreate/migration)**: a container restart can cause widespread simultaneous discontinuities in “current/peak/events/stat” files (cgroup + smaps) and CPU accounting, producing a single dense time cluster.  
- **Real transient resource event** (CPU burst + memory pressure + IO pressure): possible, but the sample shows more “structural” metrics (limits/weights/max) and many `count` anomalies, which weakens the case for a purely workload-driven spike.  
Uncertain because the output shows anomaly *scores and co-timing* but not the actual metric values/directions (spike vs drop), nor whether there was a restart, scrape gap, or exporter issue.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single correlation cluster**: `total_correlations: 1` with **`source_count: 220`**.  
- **Tight time window**: `first_seen: 1768261651`, `last_updated: 1768261751` (~100 seconds).  
- **Cross-domain simultaneous anomalies**: CPU (`cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_percentage`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.*`, `cpu.pressure.*`), memory (`cgroup.v2.memory.current`, `memory.pressure.*`, `memory.events.*`, `memory.stat.*`), IO pressure (`cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`, `io.stat.wbytes`), and smaps (`smaps_rollup.*`) all in the same cluster.  
- **Many “count” metrics with extreme scores**: e.g. `kernel_cpu_percentage:count (score: 10000000000.00)`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count (score: 10000000000.00)`, `cgroup.v2.memory.zswap.writeback:count (score: 10000000000.00)` at `timestamp 1768261750`.  
- **Smaps anomalies with implausibly huge scores**: `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg (score: 153231360000000000.00)` around `1768261747–1750`, consistent with discontinuity/bad read as well as real change.  
- **Large overall anomaly volume**: `total_anomalies: 60287` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 227`, consistent with a systemic event affecting many series.
