============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
There is a single incident window (~100s) where *almost every* container metric (CPU, memory, IO pressure, cgroup events, smaps) became anomalous at the same timestamps, indicating a broad, simultaneous state change rather than an isolated subsystem issue.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Low.**

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Metrics collection/reset artifact (most likely):** Many anomalies are on `:count` series with extreme identical scores (`10000000000.00`), consistent with counters resetting/jumping, missing samples, scrape restart, or a parsing/unit bug—this can make *everything* look anomalous at once.  
- **Container lifecycle event (restart/recreate/migration):** A container restart can reset many cgroup/stat counters simultaneously and change smaps snapshots abruptly, producing a large simultaneous cluster without an actual resource incident.  
- **Real host/container-wide resource event (CPU+memory pressure spike):** Possible (CPU pressure + memory pressure + zswap/writeback), but the presence of many “count” anomalies and absurd smaps scores makes it hard to trust this as a genuine workload symptom from this output alone.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single correlation cluster:** `total_correlations: 1` with **`source_count: 220`** spanning CPU, memory, IO pressure, smaps, hugetlb, pids, cgroup events.  
- **Tight time window:** `first_seen: 1768261651`, `last_updated: 1768261751` (~100 seconds).  
- **Many extreme `:count` anomalies:** e.g. `kernel_cpu_percentage:count (score: 10000000000.00)`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count (score: 10000000000.00)`, many others at timestamp `1768261750`.  
- **Smaps anomalies with absurd scores:** `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg (score: 153231360000000000.00)` around `1768261750`, suggestive of bad/changed input rather than normal variance.  
- **Some CPU signal present but not decisive alone:** multiple `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg` outliers (scores ~5–6) in the same general period.
