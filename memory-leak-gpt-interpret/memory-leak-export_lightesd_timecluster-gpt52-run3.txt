============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   A single tight time cluster (~100s) where *almost every* container cgroup metric (CPU, memory, IO pressure, pids, smaps) flagged simultaneously, meaning the “incident” is dominated by a synchronized, cross-metric event rather than a small subset of metrics drifting.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A (unclear).

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics pipeline/collector artifact (most likely):** Many anomalies are on `:count` series and have absurd scores (`1e10` / `1e17+`), which often happens with missing data, resets, schema/type changes, or a scrape/aggregation bug; this can make *many* unrelated metrics look anomalous at once.  
   - **Container lifecycle event (restart/migration/cgroup recreation):** A stop/start can cause many cgroup files to reset/jump simultaneously and trigger `TimeCluster` without an actual resource incident.  
   - **Real short-lived resource incident (CPU+memory pressure spike):** Possible because CPU/kernel CPU and memory pressure metrics are included, but the evidence shown is dominated by suspiciously extreme anomaly scores rather than realistic resource values.  
   **Uncertain because** the output provides anomaly *scores and co-occurrence*, but not the underlying metric values/baselines, and the extreme scores suggest detector/pipeline edge cases.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **One correlation only:** `total_correlations: 1` with `source_count: 220`, indicating a single synchronized event.  
   - **Narrow time window:** cluster `first_seen: 1768261651`, `last_updated: 1768261751` (~100 seconds).  
   - **Cross-domain metrics co-anomalied together:** CPU (`cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_percentage`, `cpu.stat.*`), memory (`memory.current`, `memory.pressure.*`, `memory.events.*`, `memory.stat.*`), IO pressure (`io.pressure.*`), pids (`pids.current`, `container.pid_count`), smaps (`smaps_rollup.*`).  
   - **Suspicious anomaly scores on `:count` series:** e.g., `kernel_cpu_percentage:count (score: 10000000000.00)`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count (score: 10000000000.00)` at timestamp `1768261750`.  
   - **Implausibly huge scores on smaps averages:** `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg (score: 153231360000000000.00)` around `1768261747–1750`.  
   - **Some genuine-looking outliers present but mixed with the above:** `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg` anomalies with scores ~5.2–5.9 across multiple timestamps.
