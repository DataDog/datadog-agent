============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- Most anomalies co-occur as one huge cluster (227 metrics) spanning CPU, memory, IO pressure, smaps, and many cgroup “config/counter” fields—suggesting a *common event affecting metric collection or the container/cgroup state*, not many independent real resource problems.  
- Smaller, tighter clusters point to a **memory-pressure episode**: direct reclaim/page scanning and zswap activity, plus memory pressure rising with memory current, and an OOM-group-kill correlated with hugetlb reservation metrics.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
- **Unclear** (signals of a real memory event exist, but the dominant pattern looks like telemetry/derivative artifacts).

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- N/A

4) **Confidence level**  
- **Low**

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Telemetry/math artifact (most likely):** many “:count” series that should be constant (limits/settings) flag as anomalies, and CPU usage shows impossible magnitudes—consistent with counter resets, unit mistakes, bad joins, scrape duplication, or derivative/rate miscalculation.  
- **Real memory pressure + OOM event (also plausible):** the presence of pgscan_direct↔zswapped and memory.current↔memory.pressure.full correlations, plus an oom_group_kill correlation, could reflect an actual workload spike; uncertainty is because these are embedded inside an enormous all-metrics cluster that can be explained by a collection/state-change artifact.

6) **Supporting evidence**  
- **Mass correlation:** `graphsketch_cluster_0` includes **227 sources** across CPU/memory/IO/smaps/cgroup fields with very high freq (`freq: 87427.5`), consistent with a single common-mode event.  
- **Implausible CPU anomaly scores/values:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec:avg (score: 3.753e13)` and `total_cpu_usage_millicores:avg (score: 190339517081.28)` suggest broken rate/units or counter reset effects.  
- **Memory-pressure indicators:**  
  - `graphsketch_cluster_2`: `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgscan_direct:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswapped:count` (direct reclaim + zswap activity).  
  - `graphsketch_cluster_6`: `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg10:count` (memory usage rising alongside full pressure).  
- **Possible OOM event:** `graphsketch_cluster_1`: `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.2MB.rsvd.max:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom_group_kill:count`.  
- **Many “constant config” fields anomalied:** e.g., `cgroup.v2.cpu.uclamp.max:count`, `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.2MB.rsvd.max:count`, multiple `...max/min/weight...:count` appearing in the big cluster—often indicates scrape/state/label changes rather than real resource dynamics.
