PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- Most anomalies co-occur as one large “everything moved together” cluster (227 sources), which often indicates a shared event affecting many counters at once (e.g., container lifecycle/collection artifact) rather than a single localized resource issue.  
- Within that, there are smaller, more specific co-anomaly pairs pointing to **memory pressure / reclaim behavior** (pgscan_direct ↔ zswapped) and a **memory pressure ↔ memory.current** relationship, plus a pair involving **OOM group kill**.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
- **Unclear**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- N/A

4) **Confidence level**  
- **Low**

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain (if not high confidence)**  
- **Telemetry/derivation issue (counter resets, scrape gaps, unit/aggregation bug):** Extremely large anomaly “scores” on monotonic counters/derived CPU metrics suggest math/normalization problems rather than real CPU usage jumps.  
- **Container restart / cgroup repopulation event:** A huge cluster including `cgroup.events.populated`, process/thread counts, many `:count` series, and “dying descendants” can occur during teardown/recreate, which would naturally synchronize many metric changes.  
- **Real memory pressure episode (possibly leading to OOM):** Smaller clusters explicitly tie reclaim/zswap and memory pressure to memory.current and include `oom_group_kill`, but without the actual metric values/timelines it’s hard to confirm severity vs. noise.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Mass co-anomaly cluster:** `graphsketch_cluster_0` has **227 sources** and very high reported frequency (**87427.5**) spanning CPU, memory, IO pressure, pids, smaps, and cgroup events.  
- **CPU metric looks suspiciously extreme:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec:avg` anomaly scores like **3.753e13** (sample anomalies).  
- **Derived CPU metric also absurd:** `total_cpu_usage_millicores:avg` shows anomaly score **190339517081.28** (sample anomalies), suggesting calculation/reset artifacts.  
- **Memory pressure/reclaim correlation present:** `graphsketch_cluster_2` links `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgscan_direct:count` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswapped:count`.  
- **Memory pressure tied to memory usage:** `graphsketch_cluster_6` links `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg10:count`.  
- **OOM signal appears but only as a small pair:** `graphsketch_cluster_1` links `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom_group_kill:count` ↔ `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.2MB.rsvd.max:count` (single timestamp window).
