PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   A single, short incident window (~100s) caused *simultaneous anomalies across almost every container metric family* (CPU, memory, I/O pressure, cgroup events, smaps), meaning the anomaly burst is time-synchronous and likely driven by one common underlying event (or a collection/telemetry artifact affecting many signals at once).

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics collection/serialization bug or reset** (most likely): many `:count` series show extreme “score=10000000000” and some `:avg` series show astronomically large scores, which is typical of missing/NaN→0, counter resets, unit parsing issues, or schema/type changes rather than real resource behavior.  
   - **Container restart / cgroup recreation / scraper restart**: would cause many cgroup/smaps series to jump/disappear at the same second and can create outliers everywhere; correlation by exact timestamp fits this.  
   - **Real incident (resource pressure spike)**: possible because CPU/memory pressure metrics are included, but the presence of many clearly non-physical anomaly scores makes it hard to trust the signals as real.  
   Uncertainty comes from not seeing the *actual metric values* (only anomaly scores) and because TimeCluster groups purely by simultaneity, which also happens with telemetry glitches.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **One correlation cluster only**: `total_correlations: 1` with `source_count: 220`, spanning `first_seen: 1768261651` to `last_updated: 1768261751` (tight, incident-like window).  
   - **Mass simultaneous scope**: cluster includes CPU (`cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_percentage`, `total_cpu_*`), memory (`cgroup.v2.memory.*`, `smaps_rollup.*`), and I/O pressure (`cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`) all together.  
   - **Highly suspicious anomaly scoring**: multiple `:count` anomalies with `score: 10000000000.00` (e.g., `kernel_cpu_percentage:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.zswap.writeback:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg300:count`).  
   - **Non-physical magnitude scores on smaps**: `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` shows extreme scores (`153231360000000000.00`, `2641920000000000.00`), consistent with parsing/unit/data-type issues rather than real memory usage changes.  
   - **Very large volume overall**: `total_anomalies: 60287` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 227`, consistent with a broad-based anomaly burst rather than a single-metric fault.
