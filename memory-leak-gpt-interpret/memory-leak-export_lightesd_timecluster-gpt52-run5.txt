============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is one large “everything-at-once” time cluster: ~220 different CPU/memory/IO/cgroup/smaps metrics all flagged as anomalous within the same ~100s window, meaning the detector saw a system-wide simultaneous discontinuity rather than a small localized metric blip.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   If real, it looks like a short incident affecting the container’s resource reporting/usage (CPU + memory pressure/swap/THP) all at once.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain?**  
   - **Metrics collection/reset artifact (most likely):** many anomalies are on `:count` series (often constant “1 sample”) with absurd scores (1e10), and smaps `avg` has astronomically large scores—patterns consistent with missing data, counter resets, exporter restart, or schema/unit changes rather than real resource explosions.  
   - **Container lifecycle event (restart/migration/cgroup recreation):** would cause many cgroup files to “jump” simultaneously (events/procs/pressure totals/peaks), producing a single time cluster.  
   - **Real resource event:** could be a brief CPU spike plus memory pressure/zswap/writeback activity, but the dominance of “count” anomalies and extreme scores makes it hard to trust as purely real usage.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster**: `total_correlations: 1` with **`source_count: 220`**, spanning CPU, memory, IO pressure, hugetlb, pids, smaps.  
   - **Tight time window**: cluster **`first_seen: 1768261651`** to **`last_updated: 1768261751`** (~100 seconds).  
   - **Many “count” anomalies with extreme scores**: e.g. `kernel_cpu_percentage:count (score: 10000000000.00)` at `1768261750`, and many cgroup fields listed as `:count` in the correlated sources.  
   - **Implausibly huge anomaly scores on smaps avg**: `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` shows scores like `153231360000000000.00` around `1768261747-1750`, suggestive of ingestion/unit/data-quality issues.  
   - **Some genuine-looking CPU signal present**: multiple `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg` anomalies with scores ~5–6 around `1768261627–1768261730`, but they’re mixed with the likely-artifact wave.
