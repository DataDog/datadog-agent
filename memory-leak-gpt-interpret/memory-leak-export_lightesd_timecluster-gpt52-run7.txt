PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all detected anomalies across CPU, memory, I/O pressure, pids, and many cgroup v2 counters happened **simultaneously in one short window (~100s)** for the same container/pod, indicating a single event affecting many metrics at once rather than independent metric issues.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain?**  
   - **Metrics collection / pipeline artifact (most likely):** Many anomalies are on `:count` series and show absurdly huge anomaly scores (e.g., `1e10`, `1e17`), consistent with **counter resets, missing data, schema/type changes, or exporter restart** causing many metrics to “jump” at the same timestamp.  
   - **Container lifecycle event (restart/recreate/migration):** A restart can simultaneously change many cgroup files and smaps readings and also cause counter discontinuities, which a time-based correlator would cluster.  
   - **Real resource incident (CPU/memory pressure spike):** Possible because CPU% and memory pressure metrics are included, but the dominance of “count” anomalies with extreme scores makes it hard to trust this as a genuine workload event.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster:** `total_correlations: 1` with **“Correlated: 220 anomalies”**.  
   - **Tight time window:** `first_seen: 1768261651`, `last_updated: 1768261751` (~100 seconds).  
   - **Very broad metric spread in the same cluster:** CPU (`cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_percentage`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`), memory (`cgroup.v2.memory.*`, `smaps_rollup.*`), I/O pressure (`cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`), pids (`cgroup.v2.pids.*`, `container.pid_count`).  
   - **Extreme/implausible anomaly scores on count series:** e.g., `kernel_cpu_percentage:count (score: 10000000000.00)`, many `cgroup.v2.*:count (score: 10000000000.00)`.  
   - **Implausibly huge score magnitude on a value series:** `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg (score: 153231360000000000.00)` around the same timestamps (`1768261747-1750`).  
   - **Same target entity across samples:** tags consistently show `container_name:foo`, same `pod_name`, same `container_id`.
