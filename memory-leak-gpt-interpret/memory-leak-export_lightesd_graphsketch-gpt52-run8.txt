PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   - Most anomalies co-occur as one big “everything moved together” cluster (227 metrics across CPU, memory, IO, pids, hugetlb, smaps), which is typical of a **container lifecycle / cgroup state transition or metrics-collection artifact** rather than a single subsystem fault.  
   - Smaller, more specific clusters point to **memory pressure + reclaim activity** (pgscan_direct ↔ zswapped), and **memory pressure tracking with memory.current** (memory.current ↔ memory.pressure.full.avg10), plus a brief **OOM-group-kill association** with hugetlb reservation.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container likely experienced a short episode of **memory pressure with reclaim/zswap and possibly an OOM group kill**, but the anomaly flood also strongly suggests a **metrics/cgroup transition artifact**.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Low**

5. **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (if not high confidence)**  
   - **Metrics ingestion/derivation bug (counter→rate, reset, unit mix-up):** extremely large anomaly “scores” on CPU usage and smaps suggest bad values/resets rather than true resource use.  
   - **Container restart / cgroup repopulation event:** the giant 227-source cluster includes cgroup “populated/frozen/procs/threads” style signals that can flip around start/stop and cause many metrics to look anomalous at once.  
   - **Host-level event affecting many metrics simultaneously (scheduler/PSI changes):** many edges tie CPU PSI metrics to memory slab/file_dirty, which could reflect real contention, but the breadth still looks more systemic than app-root-cause.  
   Uncertain because the output shows **co-occurrence patterns and anomaly scores**, but not the underlying metric values/time series shape or whether counters reset.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Mass co-anomaly:** `total_anomalies: 7014`, `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 227`, and `graphsketch_cluster_0` has **227 sources** spanning CPU/memory/IO/pids/smaps/hugetlb.  
   - **Lifecycle-ish signals included in the big cluster:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.populated:count`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen:count`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.freeze:count`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs:count`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads:count`, `nr_dying_descendants`.  
   - **Memory pressure/reclaim linkage:** `graphsketch_cluster_2` correlates `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgscan_direct:count` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswapped:count`.  
   - **Memory pressure aligns with memory usage:** `graphsketch_cluster_6` correlates `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg10:count`.  
   - **Possible OOM event signal (but only paired):** `graphsketch_cluster_1` correlates `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.2MB.rsvd.max:count` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom_group_kill:count`.  
   - **Suspiciously extreme anomaly scoring (suggesting bad data/resets):** e.g., `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec:avg (score: 3.753e13)` and `smaps_rollup.private_clean:avg (score: 2.816e16)`, plus many `:count` metrics with identical huge score `1e10`.
