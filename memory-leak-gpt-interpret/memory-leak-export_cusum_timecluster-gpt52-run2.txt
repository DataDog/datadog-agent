============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All 66 metrics anomalied in the same time window (within ~1s), indicating a single, container-wide state change/incident affecting memory, CPU, pressure/throttling, I/O, and even cgroup task/pid counts rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container experienced a sustained step-increase in anonymous memory (RSS/PSS/private dirty) consistent with a major allocation event or memory leak, which coincided with elevated CPU activity/pressure and related kernel memory/page-fault activity.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Normal workload phase change (legitimate cache/working-set growth):** CUSUM flags sustained shifts; without app context, a planned load increase or feature enabling could look identical.  
   - **Container restart / process churn / new worker fan-out:** The cluster includes cgroup procs/threads/pids metrics; a redeploy or scaling event can cause simultaneous shifts across many metrics.  
   - **Instrumentation/baseline artifact:** “Normal” is learned from the first 25% of data; if that period wasn’t representative, many metrics can appear to “shift” together.  
   Uncertainty comes from lack of absolute limits/oom events in the excerpt and no explicit “oom_kill”/restart indicator shown—only that many things changed together.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Single correlation cluster: **“Correlated: 66 anomalies in time window”**, **source_count=66**, spanning **first_seen 1768261630** to **last_updated 1768262537** (sustained).  
   - Large anonymous memory step-ups (all ~6σ):  
     - `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` **18,479,085 → ~80,3xx,xxx (6.3σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.pss_anon:avg` **18,479,085 → ~80,394,131 (6.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.active_anon:avg` **~18,478,966 → ~80,2xx,xxx (6.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon:avg` **~18,479,296 → ~80,394,131 (6.3σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.rss:avg` **23,439,607 → 86,842,756 (5.7σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.private_dirty:avg` **21,298,180 → 83,599,498 (6.1σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.pss_dirty:avg` **21,298,180 → 83,424,339 (6.1σ)**  
   - Memory-management stress indicators increased alongside:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgfault:avg` **6,745 → ~22,6xx (5.2–5.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pagetables:avg` **93,684 → 235,927 (3.9σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.kernel:avg` **346,084 → 700,416 (2.8σ)**  
   - Cluster includes CPU pressure/throttling and CPU usage metrics (`cpu.pressure.*`, `cpu.stat.*`, `total_cpu_*`, `user/system_cpu_*`) and I/O write metrics (`io.stat.wbytes`, `io.stat.wios`), consistent with a broad resource shift, not a single counter glitch.  
   - Very high event volume: **total_anomalies = 82,064** with **unique_sources_in_anomalies = 66**, consistent with prolonged, repeated anomalous points after a step-change.
