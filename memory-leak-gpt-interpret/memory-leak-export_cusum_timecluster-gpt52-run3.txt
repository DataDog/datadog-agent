============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All anomalous metrics (66 distinct sources) shifted together in the same 1‑second windows, indicating a single container-level event affecting memory, CPU, I/O, and process/thread counts simultaneously rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container experienced a sustained step-change to much higher **anonymous/private memory usage** (likely a large allocation or memory leak) accompanied by increased **CPU activity/throttling/pressure** and some **I/O writes**, consistent with a workload transition into a heavier state.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Legitimate workload phase change (not a bug):** could be an expected ramp-up (e.g., cache warmup, batch job) because the detector only knows the first 25% as “normal,” so later expected behavior can look anomalous.  
   - **Container restart/replacement or new processes:** anomalies include cgroup procs/threads/pids and “populated,” which can shift on lifecycle events; without explicit restart/OOM signals shown, cause is uncertain.  
   - **Config/limit change leading to throttling/pressure:** CPU weight/limits and throttling metrics are in the correlated set; could be a resource policy change rather than application behavior.  
   Uncertainty is mainly because the correlator is purely temporal (no causality) and the sample doesn’t show definitive outcomes (OOM kill, memory.max breach, restart event).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single correlation cluster includes all 66 sources**: `"total_correlations": 1`, `"source_count": 66`, spanning memory/CPU/I/O/PIDs.  
- **Large sustained memory shift in smaps (anonymous/private):**  
  - `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg shifted: 18,479,085 → ~80,328,454 (6.3σ)`  
  - `smaps_rollup.pss_anon:avg shifted: 18,479,085 → ~80,394,131 (6.3σ)`  
  - `smaps_rollup.private_dirty:avg shifted: 21,298,180 → ~83,599,498 (6.1σ)`  
  - `smaps_rollup.rss:avg shifted: 23,439,607 → ~86,842,756 (5.7σ)`  
- **Cgroup memory stats moved in the same direction:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.active_anon:avg shifted: 18,478,966 → ~80,214,464 (6.3σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon:avg shifted: 18,479,296 → ~80,394,131 (6.3σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.peak:avg shifted: 19,269,797 → ~81,666,588 (6.2σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgfault:avg shifted: 6,745 → ~22,692 (5.3σ)` (more paging activity)  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pagetables:avg shifted: 93,684 → 235,927 (3.9σ)` (more mappings)  
- **CPU pressure/throttling and usage metrics are part of the same cluster:** includes `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.*throttled*`, `cpu_percentage`, `total_cpu_usage_millicores`, etc.  
- **I/O write metrics co-anomalous:** cluster includes `cgroup.v2.io.stat.wbytes` and `cgroup.v2.io.stat.wios`.  
- **Container/process indicators co-anomalous:** cluster includes `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads`, `cgroup.v2.pids.current/peak`, `container.pid_count`.
