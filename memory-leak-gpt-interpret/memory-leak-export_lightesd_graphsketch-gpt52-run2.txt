PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   - Most anomalies co-occur as one large “everything moved” cluster (227 sources), suggesting a single event (or data artifact) made many container CPU/memory/IO metrics look abnormal at the same time.  
   - Within that, smaller clusters point to a memory-pressure story: direct reclaim activity and zswap activity co-occurring, memory “full” pressure co-occurring with higher memory.current, and an OOM-group-kill co-occurring with hugetlb reservation limit signals.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics/collector artifact or counter/reset/unit issue:** Extremely huge anomaly “scores” and the fact that *hundreds* of disparate “:count” metrics all anomalied together is more consistent with ingestion/resets/label churn than a real container event.  
   - **Real container stress event (CPU+memory pressure) possibly leading to OOM:** The presence of memory pressure, pgscan_direct, zswap/zswapped and an OOM-group-kill correlation could indicate genuine memory exhaustion, but the output shown doesn’t include the actual metric values/time-series to confirm.  
   - **Container lifecycle churn:** cgroup “populated”, descendants, dying_descendants correlating with many metrics can happen around rapid start/stop/recreate, which can also create apparent anomalies across many counters.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Mass co-anomaly:** `total_anomalies: 7014`, `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 227`, and `graphsketch_cluster_0` includes *227 sources* across CPU, memory, IO, smaps.  
   - **Memory pressure + usage link:** `graphsketch_cluster_6`: `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg10:count` (freq 29012.2).  
   - **Direct reclaim + zswap:** `graphsketch_cluster_2`: `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgscan_direct:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswapped:count` (freq 58158.6).  
   - **OOM signal present:** `graphsketch_cluster_1`: `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.2MB.rsvd.max:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom_group_kill:count` (freq 38035.5).  
   - **Anomaly examples show implausibly huge scores across many metrics at the same second:** e.g. `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec:avg (score 3.753e13)` and multiple `smaps_rollup.*` / `cgroup.*:count` at `timestamp 1768261668` with `score: 1e10` / `1e16+`.
