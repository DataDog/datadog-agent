============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   A single tight time cluster (within ~1s windows) captured anomalies across ~220 metrics simultaneously for one container, indicating a container-wide “event” affecting CPU, memory, and I/O/pressure signals at the same moment rather than an isolated metric spike.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Telemetry/collection artifact or counter reset/restart:** many `:count` series have extreme outlier scores (e.g., `1e10`) at the same timestamp, consistent with missing samples, resets, or schema/units changes rather than real resource behavior.  
   - **Container restart or cgroup recreation:** would cause many cgroup fields to jump/change together and can briefly distort smaps/cgroup readings.  
   - **Real short-lived resource event (CPU burst + memory pressure):** possible because CPU% anomalies occur over several timestamps, but the strongest signals shown are dominated by implausible scores/values, so it’s hard to separate true incident from instrumentation noise.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Only **1 correlation cluster**: `"total_correlations": 1` with **220 sources** (`"source_count": 220`) all co-anomalous in a narrow window.  
   - Cluster spans **CPU + memory + I/O pressure + smaps** metrics (e.g., `cgroup.v2.*.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.memory.*`, `cgroup.v2.io.*`, `smaps_rollup.*`, `*_cpu_percentage`).  
   - Time window is short: `"first_seen": 1768261651`, `"last_updated": 1768261751` (~100s).  
   - Multiple `:count` metrics show **maxed/extreme anomaly scores** at the same second (e.g., `kernel_cpu_percentage:count (score: 10000000000.00) at timestamp 1768261750`, similarly for many cgroup/memory/smaps `:count`).  
   - `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` shows **astronomical scores** (e.g., `1.53e17`) around `1768261747–1750`, suggestive of bad/changed input rather than plausible memory changes.  
   - CPU signal does show repeated anomalies over multiple timestamps (`kernel_cpu_percentage:avg` anomalies at `1768261627`, `1705`, `1707`, `1724`, `1728`, `1730`), but the dominant cluster pattern is “everything at once,” which often matches collection artifacts.
