PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There was a single incident window (~100 seconds) where *almost every* container cgroup/CPU/memory/IO metric simultaneously flagged as anomalous, suggesting a broad, synchronized change affecting metric values/availability rather than one specific resource bottleneck.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics collection/artifact issue (most likely):** many `:count` series show extreme “outlier” scores (e.g., `1e10`) across *hundreds* of sources at the exact same second, which is typical of missing/constant/zero/NaN handling, counter resets, or a scrape/agent restart causing widespread discontinuities.  
   - **Container restart / cgroup recreation:** a restart can reset numerous cgroup files/counters at once and create a burst of “anomalies” across many metrics.  
   - **Real node-level incident (CPU/memory/IO pressure):** possible because CPU pressure and memory pressure metrics are included, but the pattern is too all-encompassing and dominated by `:count` anomalies to conclude real contention from this output alone.  
   Uncertain because the output provides anomaly *scores and co-occurrence*, but not the underlying metric values (direction/magnitude) or operational events (restarts, scrape gaps).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Only **1 correlation cluster**: `"Correlated: 220 anomalies in time window"` with **220 sources**.  
   - Cluster time bounds are tight: **first_seen 1768261651** to **last_updated 1768261751** (~100s).  
   - Many sources are `:count` and span **cgroup events, cpu.stat, memory.stat, PSI (cpu/memory/io pressure), smaps_rollup**, etc.—i.e., very broad surface area.  
   - Sample anomalies include multiple `:count` metrics with **score = 10000000000.00** at the *same timestamp* **1768261750** (e.g., `kernel_cpu_percentage:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.zswap.writeback:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg300:count`).  
   - Some `avg` metrics show absurdly huge scores at the same time (e.g., `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` score `1.532e17`), consistent with a discontinuity/artifact rather than a plausible physical change.  
   - Overall volume is extreme: **60287 total anomalies** across **227 unique sources**, yet only **one** time-cluster correlation, implying a single synchronized event dominates.
