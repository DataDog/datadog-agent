============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All 66 metrics (CPU, memory, I/O, PIDs, pressure, smaps) began anomalizing together in one long, contiguous time cluster, indicating a single container-level event/phase change affecting most resource signals simultaneously rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container likely underwent a major workload/state change that drove a large sustained increase in anonymous/private memory (and associated kernel/page-table activity) with concurrent CPU pressure/throttling signals.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Container restart / process churn / config change**: Many cgroup “static-ish” fields (e.g., `cpu.weight`, `cpu.weight.nice`, `memory.max`, `pids.max`, `oom.group`) appearing as anomalous suggests a lifecycle or control-plane change, not purely “resource stress.” Without raw values/timeline it’s hard to confirm restart vs genuine saturation.  
   - **Metric collection/labeling artifact**: A simultaneous shift across *everything* can also come from a scraping/aggregation change, unit change, or switching the observed cgroup path; the correlator only uses simultaneity and CUSUM can flag a new baseline as “sustained anomaly.”  
   - **Legitimate step-change in workload**: Could be a planned traffic ramp or feature toggle that increases memory and CPU; “problem” depends on whether this violates SLOs/limits (not shown).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Single correlation cluster: **“Correlated: 66 anomalies in time window”**, spanning **first_seen 1768261630 → last_updated 1768262537** (sustained period).  
   - Large sustained **anonymous/private memory jump** (smaps + cgroup agree):  
     - `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` **18.5M → ~80.3M (6.3σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.pss_anon:avg` **18.5M → ~80.4M (6.3σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.private_dirty:avg` **21.3M → ~83.6M (6.1σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon:avg` **18.5M → ~80.3M (6.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.peak:avg` **~19.3M → ~81.7M (6.2σ)**  
   - Memory-management side effects increased:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgfault:avg` **6745 → ~22690 (5.2–5.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pagetables:avg` **93685 → 235927 (3.9σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.kernel:avg` **346084 → 590506–700416 (2.0–2.8σ)**  
   - Concurrent anomalies include **CPU pressure/throttling and usage** metrics (`cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.*`, `total_cpu_*`, `system_cpu_*`, `user_cpu_*`) and **I/O** (`cgroup.v2.io.stat.wbytes/wios`) and **PIDs** (`cgroup.v2.pids.current/peak`, `container.pid_count`).
