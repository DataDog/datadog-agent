============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all anomalous metrics (66 sources) are moving together as one cluster, indicating a single container-level “state change” affecting CPU (usage/system/throttling/pressure), memory (anon/rss/pss, slab, file cache), I/O, and process/thread counts rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container likely entered a sustained high-load episode with **CPU saturation + throttling** and a **large increase in anonymous memory (RSS/PSS)** consistent with a workload surge or a memory-growing process (possible leak) that is being CPU-limited.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities & why uncertain**  
   - **Normal workload phase change / scale-up inside the container** (e.g., new worker threads, batch job): many metrics shift together, including pids/procs/threads; could be expected behavior.  
   - **Configuration/limit change rather than app behavior** (CPU/memory limits/weights changed): anomalies include `memory.max` and CPU weight fields shifting, which can occur due to orchestration updates.  
   - **Instrumentation/collection artifact**: extremely high anomaly count (23,871) with many low-sigma shifts (0.6–0.9σ) suggests the detector may be over-triggering after a baseline mismatch, making it harder to separate “real incident” from “new normal.”

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single large correlated cluster:** `total_correlations: 1`, `source_count: 66`, title indicates strong co-movement (“freq: 93909.6”).  
   - **CPU load + throttling increased:**  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec` shifted **5112.81 → 64695.17 (3.5σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.system_usec` shifted **2293.39 → 44878.00 (7.8σ)**  
     - Throttling metrics anomalous: `nr_throttled`, `throttled_usec`, `local.throttled_usec` (many high-frequency edges among these).  
     - CPU pressure involved in the correlated sources (`cpu.pressure.full.*`, `cpu.pressure.some.*`).  
   - **Memory (anonymous/RSS-like) jumped materially:**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon` shifted **~6.36MB → ~28.6MB (4.2σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.peak` shifted **~6.9MB → ~29.4MB (3.9σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.active_anon` shifted **~6.36MB → ~28.7MB (4.2σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.shared_clean` shifted **64KB → 4.1MB (8.1σ)** (large mapping/cache change).  
   - **Resource-limit / policy signals changed too:**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.max` shifted **160,259,973 → 268,435,456**  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice` shifted **11.34 → 19.00**  
   - **Process/thread activity moved with the event:**  
     - `cgroup.v2.pids.peak` shifted **4.78 → 8.00**; `pids.current` and `kernel_stack` also shifted and are a top edge pair (`kernel_stack ↔ pids.current`, 17,484 observations).  
   - **GraphSketch edges tie throttling ↔ memory/file/slab together at high frequency**, e.g.  
     - `cpu.stat.throttled_usec ↔ memory.stat.file` frequency **93909.6**  
     - `memory.oom.group ↔ memory.stat.slab_reclaimable` frequency **93909.6**
