PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All detected anomalies form a single, highly coherent co-occurrence cluster: when one metric shifts, many CPU, memory (cgroup + smaps), pids/threads, and some I/O-related metrics shift together within ~10s—suggesting one underlying event/change affecting the whole container rather than isolated metric noise.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
A step-change in workload caused a sustained increase in CPU usage (with throttling/CPU pressure) and a large rise in resident/anonymous memory in the container.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Medium.**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Container restart/redeploy or process tree change**: would shift many baselines at once (threads/procs/pids, memory, CPU) without being a “fault” per se; uncertainty because we don’t see explicit restart markers, only correlated metric shifts.  
- **Resource limit/CPU quota change**: could explain increased throttling/pressure and changes like `memory.max` and `cpu_limit_millicores`; uncertainty because the output shows shifts but not the control-plane event that caused them.  
- **Memory leak vs. legitimate caching/load**: anon/peak increases could be leak or just new steady-state; uncertainty because we only see “shift” detection, not longer-term trend after the shift.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single dominant correlation cluster**: `total_correlations: 1`, `source_count: 66`, pattern `graphsketch_cluster_5` spanning CPU, memory, pids, smaps, I/O.  
- **Large CPU step-up**: `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec:avg shifted ... (3.5σ)` and `system_usec ... (7.8σ)`.  
- **CPU throttling/pressure anomalies**: `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.nr_throttled` and `throttled_usec` shifted; CPU pressure metrics included in cluster; strong edges among throttling + pressure.  
- **Large memory step-up (anon/rss-related)**: `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon ... (4.2σ)`, `memory.peak ... (3.9σ)`, `active_anon ... (4.2σ)`, `smaps_rollup.shared_clean ... (8.1σ)`.  
- **Process/threads involvement**: anomalies include `cgroup.v2.pids.peak`, `pids.current`, `cgroup.procs`, and cluster title references `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads ↔ smaps_rollup.rss`.  
- **Edges show repeated co-occurrence of CPU throttling with memory/file metrics** (e.g., `throttled_usec ↔ memory.stat.file` and `nr_throttled ↔ slab_reclaimable` with very high observations/frequency), consistent with a sustained new operating regime.
