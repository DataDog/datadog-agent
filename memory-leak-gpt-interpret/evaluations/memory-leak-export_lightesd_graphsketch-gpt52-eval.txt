Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 15  
3. **Evidence**: Said "**Unclear**" and leaned toward "**artifact/instrumentation or container restart/teardown event**"; only vaguely mentioned "**memory pressure culminating in OOM**" as an alternative, never “memory leak” or unbounded memory growth.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify a memory leak and instead primarily attributed the anomalies to metrics artifacts or container lifecycle events, with only a speculative mention of OOM/memory pressure.
