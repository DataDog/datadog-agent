EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 82  
3. **Evidence**: Explicitly says “likely a large allocation or **memory leak**” and highlights “sustained step-change to much higher anonymous/private memory usage.”  
4. **Summary**: It correctly flagged sustained anomalous memory growth and explicitly mentioned a possible memory leak, but hedged with alternatives and didn’t firmly conclude “this is a memory leak.”
