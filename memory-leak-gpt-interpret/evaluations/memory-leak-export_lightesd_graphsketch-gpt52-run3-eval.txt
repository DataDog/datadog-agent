Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 20  
3. **Evidence**: It says “Unclear,” focuses on “telemetry/derivation issue,” “container restart,” and only mentions “memory pressure episode (possibly leading to OOM)”—no “memory leak” / sustained memory growth attribution.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify an application-level memory leak and instead treated the situation as unclear with alternative explanations like telemetry artifacts or restarts.
