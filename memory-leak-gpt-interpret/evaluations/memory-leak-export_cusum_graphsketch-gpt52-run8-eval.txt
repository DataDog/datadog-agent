Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 62  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “large rise in anonymous memory (RSS/anon)” and “memory pressure” but frames it as a “sustained workload change” and never says “memory leak” / unbounded growth / OOM-kill due to leak.  
4. **Summary**: It noticed sustained memory (anon/RSS) growth consistent with a leak, but diagnosed it primarily as a workload/CPU shift rather than explicitly identifying a memory leak.
