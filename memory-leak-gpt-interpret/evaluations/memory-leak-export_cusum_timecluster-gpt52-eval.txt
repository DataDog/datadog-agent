Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 62  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “sustained increase in anonymous/private memory,” “major workload/state change,” and memory metrics jumps, but never says “memory leak,” “unbounded growth,” or “leaking allocations/OOM.”  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis correctly focused on sustained memory growth but framed it as a generic workload/state change rather than explicitly identifying an application-level memory leak.
