Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 82  
3. **Evidence**: Phrases like “**memory surge/leak**”, “**sustained step-up in anonymous/private memory**”, and “**unbounded memory growth**”-style framing (though mixed with “workload phase change” and “restart” alternatives).  
4. **Summary**: It strongly pointed to sustained memory growth consistent with a leak and explicitly mentioned “leak” as a likely cause, but did not firmly conclude an application-level memory leak as the root cause.
