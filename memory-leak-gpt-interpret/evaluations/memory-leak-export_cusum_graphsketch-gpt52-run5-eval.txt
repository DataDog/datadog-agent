Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 62  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “major rise in anonymous memory/RSS,” “memory growth,” “memory-growing process,” but explicitly says patterns could be “new mapping… rather than ‘leak’” and does not conclude “memory leak.”  
4. **Summary**: It recognizes sustained/abnormal memory growth consistent with a leak but stops short of diagnosing a memory leak as the root cause and frames it as a generic workload change.
