Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 20  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “memory pressure… reclaim/zswap and possibly an OOM group kill” and “metrics/cgroup transition artifact,” but never “memory leak,” “unbounded growth,” or sustained heap increase.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis notes possible memory pressure/OOM signals but attributes them to artifacts/lifecycle events and does not identify an application-level memory leak.
