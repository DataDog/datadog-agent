EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no  
2. **Score**: 15  
3. **Evidence**: It says “**Unclear**,” “**N/A**,” focuses on “**container lifecycle/measurement discontinuity**,” and only mentions “**memory pressure…possibly leading to OOM kills**” without identifying a leak or gradual memory growth.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify a memory leak and instead treated the event mainly as a lifecycle/metrics-reset artifact with low-confidence mention of transient memory pressure/OOM.
