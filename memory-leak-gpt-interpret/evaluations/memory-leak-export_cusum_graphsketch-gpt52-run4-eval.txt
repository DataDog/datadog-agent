EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: **no** - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: **35**  
3. **Evidence**: It mentions “sustained workload step-change,” “memory growth… anonymous/RSS,” and “oom-group-related signals,” but never attributes it to an application-level leak/unbounded retention.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis noticed sustained memory increase and OOM-related signals but misframed it as a generic workload step-change rather than identifying a memory leak.
