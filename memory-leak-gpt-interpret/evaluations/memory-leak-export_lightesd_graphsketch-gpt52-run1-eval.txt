Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: It explicitly says “**Unclear**” and lists alternatives like “**telemetry/math artifact**,” “**container lifecycle event**,” and “**memory-pressure incident… possibly OOM**” with no mention of “memory leak” or sustained memory growth.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify a memory leak, instead concluding uncertainty and focusing on instrumentation artifacts and generic memory pressure/OOM possibilities.
