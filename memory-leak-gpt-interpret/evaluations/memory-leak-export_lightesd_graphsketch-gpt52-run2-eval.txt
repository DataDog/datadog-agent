Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 15  
3. **Evidence**: It explicitly says “**Unclear**” and gives alternatives like “**metrics/collector artifact**” and generic “**memory exhaustion/OOM**” but never mentions “memory leak” or unbounded memory growth.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis noted possible memory pressure/OOM signals but did not identify the root cause as an application-level memory leak and ultimately labeled the situation unclear.
