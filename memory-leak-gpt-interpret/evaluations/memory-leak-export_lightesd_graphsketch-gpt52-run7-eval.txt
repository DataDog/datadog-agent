Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 62  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “severe memory pressure… and an OOM group kill,” “direct reclaim/zswap activity,” and memory pressure correlations, but never states “memory leak” or “unbounded memory growth.”  
4. **Summary**: It correctly diagnosed memory pressure culminating in OOM, which is consistent with a leak, but it did not explicitly identify the root cause as an application memory leak.
