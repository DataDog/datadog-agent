EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: It says “**Unclear**”, “**N/A**”, and focuses on “**metrics/collection artifact or restart**” and a possible “**CPU+memory pressure spike**” with no mention of memory leak, gradual memory growth, or OOM due to leaking allocations.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify a memory leak and instead treated the incident as unclear/possibly telemetry artifact or a generic spike.
