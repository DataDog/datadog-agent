EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: **partial** - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: **82**  
3. **Evidence**: Phrases like “**consistent with a memory leak**,” “**likely rapid heap growth/large allocation burst**,” and sustained increases in “**anonymous/private memory usage**.”  
4. **Summary**: It strongly points to sustained memory growth and explicitly mentions a memory leak as a likely cause, but hedges with workload-change alternatives rather than clearly concluding “this is a memory leak.”
