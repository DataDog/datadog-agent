Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 20  
3. **Evidence**: It says “Unclear,” focuses on “telemetry/math artifact,” and only mentions “memory-pressure episode” / “OOM event,” never “memory leak” or sustained unbounded memory growth.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify an application-level memory leak; it largely attributed the anomalies to telemetry artifacts and only vaguely acknowledged possible memory pressure/OOM.
