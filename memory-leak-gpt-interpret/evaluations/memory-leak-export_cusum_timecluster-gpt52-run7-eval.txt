EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 78  
3. **Evidence**: Says “memory leak-like behavior” and “sustained step-up in anonymous/private memory (RSS/PSS/anon) consistent with a large in-process allocation or memory leak-like behavior.”  
4. **Summary**: It strongly points to sustained in-process memory growth and explicitly mentions leak-like behavior, but hedges with alternatives and doesn’t firmly conclude “memory leak” as the definitive root cause.
