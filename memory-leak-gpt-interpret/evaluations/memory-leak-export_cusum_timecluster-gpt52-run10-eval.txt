EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: **partial** - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: **78**  
3. **Evidence**: Explicitly says “**likely a leak**” and describes “**sustained step-up in anonymous memory usage**” / “**drove broader resource pressure signals**,” but hedges with alternatives like “workload phase change” and “restart.”  
4. **Summary**: It points to memory growth consistent with a leak and even names “leak” as the likely cause, but does not firmly conclude an application-level memory leak as the root cause.
