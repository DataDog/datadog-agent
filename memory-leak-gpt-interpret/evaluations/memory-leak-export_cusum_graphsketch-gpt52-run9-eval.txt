Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 62  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “memory (anon/RSS) … growth” and discusses “Kernel/page-cache or memory reclaim effects instead of ‘app memory leak’” but primary diagnosis is “sustained workload shift” (not a leak).  
4. **Summary**: It recognized sustained memory growth and even raised memory leak as an alternative, but did not conclude the root cause was an application memory leak.
