Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 62  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “memory growth (anon + smaps RSS/PSS)” and “anonymous memory/RSS surged” but frames it as “resource-saturation… driven by a workload change,” never calling out a leak/OOM pattern.  
4. **Summary**: It recognized abnormal sustained memory increase, but did not correctly conclude the root cause as an application-level memory leak.
