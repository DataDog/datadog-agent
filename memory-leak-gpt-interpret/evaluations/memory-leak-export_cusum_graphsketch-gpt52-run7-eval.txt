EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 72  
3. **Evidence**: Said “memory growth… possible leak or in-memory growth” and noted “Memory anon growth… big rise in anonymous memory/RSS,” but framed it primarily as a “sustained workload shift” with CPU/throttling rather than a clear leak/OOM.  
4. **Summary**: It partially identified a memory leak by explicitly mentioning “possible leak” and sustained anon/RSS growth, but did not clearly conclude the root cause is an application-level memory leak.
