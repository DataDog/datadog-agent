Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 58  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “large rise in anonymous/RSS memory,” “possibly near-OOM behavior,” and contrasts “kernel/page-cache behavior vs app leak,” but primarily diagnoses “workload ramp-up… more threads/processes… CPU throttling.”  
4. **Summary**: It recognized sustained memory growth/pressure but did not clearly attribute it to an application-level memory leak, instead focusing on workload/CPU scale-up as the main cause.
