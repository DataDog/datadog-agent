EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 78  
3. **Evidence**: Phrases like “likely memory growth/leak” and “sustained step-increase in anonymous memory (RSS/PSS/private dirty)” indicate leak/memory growth, but it hedges with alternatives and doesn’t firmly conclude “memory leak” as root cause.  
4. **Summary**: It broadly points to sustained heap growth consistent with a memory leak, but remains non-committal and frames it as a possible cause rather than the definitive diagnosis.
