Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 65  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “possible memory growth” and “large rise in anonymous/RSS memory,” but frames it as “heavier workload phase/resource contention” and never explicitly calls it a leak/OOM-driven leak.  
4. **Summary**: It recognized sustained memory growth consistent with a leak, but primarily diagnosed a workload/contension step-change rather than clearly identifying an application memory leak.
