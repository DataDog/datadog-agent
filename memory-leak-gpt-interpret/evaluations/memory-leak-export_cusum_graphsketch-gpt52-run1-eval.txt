Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: **partial** - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: **62**  
3. **Evidence**: Phrases like “sharp rise in anonymous memory (heap)”, “elevated memory footprint”, and “Good for: … memory leaks” imply memory growth but it never explicitly calls it a “memory leak” and frames it as a “sustained workload change.”  
4. **Summary**: It detected sustained heap/anon memory growth consistent with a leak, but did not clearly diagnose it as an application-level memory leak (and emphasized workload/system factors instead).
