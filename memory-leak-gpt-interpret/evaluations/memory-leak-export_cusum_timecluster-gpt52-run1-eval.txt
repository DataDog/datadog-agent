Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 78  
3. **Evidence**: Phrases like “anonymous memory/RSS/PSS (likely heap growth/leak…)” and “heap growth/leak or workload phase change” indicate a leak hypothesis but not a definitive diagnosis.  
4. **Summary**: It correctly focused on sustained anonymous memory growth and explicitly mentioned a possible heap leak, but hedged heavily and didn’t clearly conclude “memory leak” as the root cause.
