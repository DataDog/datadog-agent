EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 15  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosis says “**Unclear**,” suggests “**metrics collection/reset artifact**,” “**container lifecycle event**,” or a “**short incident**,” with no mention of “memory leak,” sustained memory growth, or OOM due to leakage.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify a memory leak and instead leaned toward instrumentation/artifact or transient system-wide event explanations.
