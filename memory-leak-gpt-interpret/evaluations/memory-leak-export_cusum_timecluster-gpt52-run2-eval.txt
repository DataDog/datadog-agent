EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: **partial** - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: **80**  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “**major allocation event or memory leak**” and “**sustained step-increase in anonymous memory … consistent with … memory leak**.”  
4. **Summary**: It correctly flagged sustained unbounded memory growth and explicitly included “memory leak” as a likely cause, but hedged between leak vs one-time allocation/workload change and didn’t firmly conclude leak.
