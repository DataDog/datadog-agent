Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 60  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “large rise in resident/anonymous memory,” and explicitly lists “Memory leak vs. legitimate caching/load” as an alternative, but primary diagnosis is “step-change in workload” with CPU/throttling.  
4. **Summary**: It recognized sustained memory growth signals but did not clearly diagnose the root cause as an application-level memory leak.
