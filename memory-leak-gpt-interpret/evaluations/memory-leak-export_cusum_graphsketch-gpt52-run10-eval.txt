Checking if diagnosis identified: memory leak...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: partial - Did it identify memory leak?  
2. **Score**: 75  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “memory-growing process (possible leak)” and “large increase in anonymous memory (RSS/PSS)” but frames it mainly as “CPU saturation + throttling” / “high-load episode.”  
4. **Summary**: It partially identified a memory leak by explicitly flagging a “possible leak” and sustained anon memory growth, but did not clearly conclude the primary issue is a memory leak/OOM-driven failure mode.
