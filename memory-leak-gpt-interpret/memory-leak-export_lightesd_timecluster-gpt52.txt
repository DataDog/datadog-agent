PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   One short time window (~100s) triggered simultaneous anomalies across ~220 container-level CPU, memory, I/O pressure, and smaps metrics, suggesting a single event affecting the whole cgroup/pod at once rather than isolated metric issues.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain?**  
   - **Metrics/collection artifact or restart:** Many anomalies are on `:count` series with identical extreme scores (e.g., `10000000000.00`) and implausibly huge scores on smaps averages, consistent with missing data, resets, NaNs/inf handling, unit changes, or a collector crash/restart causing mass outliers.  
   - **Real container incident (CPU+memory pressure spike):** Kernel CPU anomalies plus memory pressure/zswap/writeback counters could reflect genuine reclaim/swap pressure and CPU contention—but the “everything anomalied” pattern is also exactly what happens when the input stream glitches.  
   Uncertain because the output shows **outlier scores** but not the underlying raw values, directions (spike/drop), or whether the container actually hit limits/oom-kills.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster:** `total_correlations: 1` with **“Correlated: 220 anomalies”**.  
   - **Tight time bounds:** `first_seen: 1768261651`, `last_updated: 1768261751` (~100 seconds).  
   - **Broad metric coverage:** cluster includes CPU (`cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_percentage`, throttling stats), memory (`memory.current`, `memory.events.*`, `memory.pressure.*`), I/O pressure, and many `smaps_rollup.*` series—indicative of a global event or global instrumentation issue.  
   - **Suspicious anomaly scoring:** multiple `:count` anomalies with identical **score `10000000000.00`** (e.g., `kernel_cpu_percentage:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.avg300:count`).  
   - **Implausibly huge smaps scores:** `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` scores like `153231360000000000.00`, suggestive of data corruption/unit mismatch rather than a normal workload change.  
   - **Some plausible signal mixed in:** repeated `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg` outliers with scores ~5–6 across nearby timestamps, which could be real—but they occur in the same window as the mass `:count` outliers.
