============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All 66 metric sources anomalied together in the same time window, indicating a single container-level event/transition that simultaneously changed memory, CPU, I/O, and process/thread counters (i.e., one incident rather than unrelated metric noise).

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container experienced a sustained step-up in anonymous/private memory (RSS/PSS/anon) consistent with a large in-process allocation or memory leak-like behavior, with associated increases in paging activity and kernel memory.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **Alternative possibilities / why uncertain (not high confidence)**  
   - **Intentional workload phase change / warm-up / cache build:** could be a normal transition where the app loads data into memory; CUSUM flags sustained shifts but can’t label intent.  
   - **Container restart/redeploy changing baseline:** a lifecycle event can cause many cgroup counters/levels to shift together; TimeCluster only groups by time, not causality.  
   - **Sampling/metric pipeline artifact:** widespread simultaneous anomalies across many metrics could also occur if collection semantics changed (though the strong, coherent memory-direction shift argues against pure noise).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Single correlation cluster: **“Correlated: 66 anomalies in time window”** with **source_count=66**, spanning memory, CPU, I/O, pids/threads.  
   - Large sustained memory shift in anon/private metrics:  
     - `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` **18,479,085 → ~80,3xx,xxx (6.3σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.pss_anon:avg` **18,479,085 → ~80,394,131 (6.3σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.private_dirty:avg` **21,298,180 → ~83,6xx,xxx (6.1σ)**  
     - `smaps_rollup.rss:avg` **23,439,607 → ~86,842,756 (5.7σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon:avg` **18,479,296 → ~80,282,376 (6.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.peak:avg` **19,269,797 → ~81,666,588 (6.2σ)**  
   - Memory-management pressure indicators moved too:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgfault:avg` **6,745 → ~22,6xx (5.2–5.3σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pagetables:avg` **93,684 → 235,927 (3.9σ)**  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.kernel:avg` **346,084 → ~590k–700k (2.0–2.8σ)**  
   - Time window is sustained (not a single spike): correlation `first_seen=1768261630`, `last_updated=1768262537`.
