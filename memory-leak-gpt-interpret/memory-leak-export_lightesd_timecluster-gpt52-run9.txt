============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There was essentially one incident window (~100s) where *almost every collected container metric* simultaneously registered as anomalous, indicating a broad “everything changed at once” event rather than a small subset of related signals.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics pipeline/collector glitch or reset** (most likely): many anomalies are on `:count` series and have absurd scores (1e10), consistent with missing samples, counter resets, NaNs-to-zero, unit changes, or a scrape/agent restart causing baseline breakage.  
   - **Container/cgroup recreation (pod restart) causing widespread counter resets**: would make many cgroup/smaps counters/“count” fields jump/discontinue simultaneously.  
   - **Real resource incident (CPU + memory pressure spike)**: possible because CPU pressure and memory pressure metrics are included, but the “everything at once” pattern plus extreme scores makes it hard to trust as purely real behavior.  
   Uncertainty comes from not seeing the *actual values* (only scores) and because TimeCluster groups purely by timestamp, so it can’t distinguish “real correlated stress” from “simultaneous measurement artifact.”

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster**: `total_correlations: 1` with **`source_count: 220`** (“Correlated: 220 anomalies in time window”).  
   - **Very tight time window**: `first_seen: 1768261651`, `last_updated: 1768261751` (~100 seconds).  
   - **Cross-domain simultaneity**: cluster includes CPU (`cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_percentage`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`), memory (`cgroup.v2.memory.*`, `smaps_rollup.*`), IO pressure (`cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`), pids, hugetlb, etc.  
   - **Many extreme/implausible anomaly scores on `:count` metrics**: e.g. `kernel_cpu_percentage:count (score: 10000000000.00)`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count (score: 10000000000.00)`, multiple others at the same timestamp `1768261750`.  
   - **Suspiciously huge score magnitudes on smaps averages**: `smaps_rollup.anonymous:avg` scores like `153231360000000000.00`, suggesting a data quality/unit/parse issue rather than a normal workload change.  
   - **Volume suggests systemic effect**: `total_anomalies: 60287` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 227`, yet only one time-clustered correlation event, consistent with a systemic break around that period.
