// FlareBuilder contains all the helpers to add files to a flare archive.
//
// When adding data to a flare the builder will do multiple things internally.
//
// First a log of the archive creation will be kept and shipped with the flare. When using the the FlareBuilder you
// should not stop at the first error. We want to collect as much as possible. Any error returned by the a FlareBuilder
// method is added to the flare log. In general, you can safely ignore those errors unless sending a flare without some
// file/information would not make sense.
//
// The builder will automatically scrub any sensitive data from content and copied files. Still carefully analyze what
// is being added to ensure that it contains no credentials or unnecessary user-specific data. The FlareBuilder scrubs
// secrets that match pre-programmed patterns, but it is always better to not capture data containing secrets, than to
// scrub that data.
//
// Everytime a file is copied to the flare the original permissions and ownership of the file is recorded (Unix only).
//
// There are reserved path in the flare: "permissions.log" and "flare-creationg.log" (both at the root of the flare).
// Note as well that the flare does nothing to prevent files to be overwritten by different calls. It's up to the caller
// to make sure the path used in the flare doesn't clash with other modules.
