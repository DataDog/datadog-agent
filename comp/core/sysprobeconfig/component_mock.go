// Package sysprobeconfig implements a component to handle system-probe configuration.  This
// component temporarily wraps pkg/config.
//
// This component initializes pkg/config based on the bundle params, and
// will return the same results as that package.  This is to support migration
// to a component architecture.  When no code still uses pkg/config, that
// package will be removed.
//
// The mock component does nothing at startup, beginning with an empty config.
// It also overwrites the pkg/config.SystemProbe for the duration of the test.
