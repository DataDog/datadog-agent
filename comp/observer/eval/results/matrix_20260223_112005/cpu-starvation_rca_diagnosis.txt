============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
There is a single TimeCluster where **66 different metrics** from the same container/pod anomalied **simultaneously** (within ~1s), indicating one coordinated event affecting CPU, memory, pids/threads, and I/O/pressure rather than independent random outliers.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
The `crasher` container in pod `crash-loop-2ad3b6ae` experienced a sudden, sustained resource surge (CPU contention/throttling + memory growth + high thread/pid activity + I/O pressure) consistent with a crash-looping or runaway process.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Medium.**

5) **If not high confidence: alternatives + why uncertain**  
- **Legitimate workload step change / load test:** could explain broad simultaneous shifts (CUSUM flags sustained shifts, not necessarily “bad”), but the pod/container name suggests intentional failure behavior.  
- **Container restart/recreate artifacts:** cgroup “populated” flipping and many “config-ish” metrics shifting could come from lifecycle events; without explicit restart counters/events, causality is uncertain.  
- **Metrics/tag mismatch:** sample anomalies reference `container_id:f084...` while the clustered sources use `container_id:9375...` (same names/pod), which could indicate multiple instances and complicate attribution.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **One cluster only:** `total_correlations: 1` with **“TimeCluster: 66 anomalies”** (broad, simultaneous impact).  
- **CPU contention/throttling:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.total` shifted to **159266** from **30131**  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.local.throttled_usec` shifted to **319029** from **60356**  
- **Memory jump:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.current` shifted to **7,991,296** from **1,511,866**  
  - `smaps_rollup.rss` shifted to **12,423,168** from **2,350,329**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon` shifted to **7,262,208** from **1,373,931**  
- **Process/thread explosion signals:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads` shifted to **13,085** from **2,475**  
  - `cgroup.v2.pids.max` shifted to **2,135** from **404** (suggests a limit/config change or observed shift in that metric)  
- **I/O activity and pressure:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rios` shifted to **6.0** from **0.30**  
  - `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rbytes` shifted to **86,016** from **4,230**  
  - `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.total` shifted to **40** from **7.57**  
- **Lifecycle hint:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.populated` shifted to **1.0** from **0.19** (cgroup becoming populated aligns with start/restart).

7) **RCA support?**  
No—**RCA is not present** in this output, so there are no ranked root candidates to confirm or refute the conclusion.
