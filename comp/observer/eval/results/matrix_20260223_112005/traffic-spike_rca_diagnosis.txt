============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- **TimeCluster 1 (236 sources, ~86s window)**: A large set of metrics across **multiple containers** (todo-frontend, todo-backend, todo-redis, cleanup) anomalied **at the same time**, spanning **CPU usage/throttling/PSI, memory stats/smaps, I/O stats/PSI, pids, and even config-like weights**. This looks like a **broad, simultaneous “state change”** affecting many metrics rather than a single narrow symptom.  
- **TimeCluster 2 (10 sources, single timestamp)**: A **small, backend-only CPU cluster** (cpu_percentage variants + memory.stat.sock) later, suggesting a **brief backend CPU event**.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A (unclear).

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
**Low** (on “there is a real incident/problem”).

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Planned/expected workload phase change or benchmark step**: Many metrics shift together across all containers, consistent with a coordinated scenario step (e.g., load test start/stop, deployment phase). Uncertain because we don’t see app-level errors/latency, only resource metrics.  
- **Instrumentation / baseline / dedup artifact**: CUSUM learns from first 25%; if the system transitions from “idle” to “normal running,” CUSUM can flag a huge number of “sustained shifts.” Also several “metrics” like **cpu.weight / io.weight / memory.max / pids.max** aren’t expected to fluctuate frequently, suggesting collection/parsing resets or label/cardinality quirks.  
- **Node-level resource contention episode** (CPU + I/O pressure): PSI anomalies and throttling-like metrics could indicate real contention, but it’s unclear because the cluster includes many “state/config” metrics and spans unrelated containers simultaneously without a clear single culprit.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- Massive anomaly volume with heavy dedup: **total_anomalies 213,627; dedup_skipped 211,055** (suggests repetitive triggering once a shift occurred).  
- **TimeCluster 1 spans multiple containers/qos classes** at the same time: todo-frontend, todo-backend, todo-redis (Burstable) and cleanup (BestEffort).  
- Sample sustained shifts at ~1769636453–1769636458:  
  - **cleanup I/O + CPU up**: `io.stat.rbytes` **81920 vs 4028**, `io.stat.rios` **5.00 vs 0.25**, `cpu.stat.usage_usec` **27513 vs 1353** (all ~4.4σ).  
  - **todo-frontend memory jump**: `smaps_rollup.private_dirty` **17.9M vs 2.94M**, `rss` **44.6M vs 9.88M**, `pss` **32.0M vs 7.02M**.  
  - **PSI signals present in cluster**: `cpu.pressure.*`, `io.pressure.*`, `cgroup.pressure`.  
- **TimeCluster 2** is a **single-point backend CPU burst**: cpu_percentage/system/user/total + `memory.stat.sock` all on backend at **1769636511**.

7) **RCA present? Do candidates support the conclusion?**  
- **No RCA section is present** in the provided JSON, so there are **no root candidates to confirm or refute** the conclusion.
