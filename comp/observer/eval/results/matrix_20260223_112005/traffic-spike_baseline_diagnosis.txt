This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- **TimeCluster 1 (236 metrics, ~86s window)**: A very large set of metrics across **multiple containers** (todo-frontend, todo-backend, todo-redis, cleanup) all flipped into “shifted” state at roughly the same time, spanning CPU, memory, IO, pids, and pressure signals. This looks like a **system-wide/state-change event** rather than an isolated single-metric blip.  
- **TimeCluster 2 (10 metrics, single timestamp)**: A smaller, **backend-only** cluster focused on **CPU utilization** plus one memory stat (sock), suggesting a brief backend-local burst separate from the broad cluster.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A.

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
**Low.**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Metrics/collection or interpretation artifact**: Several “anomalies” are on **configuration-like / constant-ish fields** (e.g., `cpu.weight`, `cpu.weight.nice`, `io.weight.default`, `memory.max`, `pids.max`) that usually change only on cgroup updates; a coordinated “shift” across many such fields can indicate **cgroup recreation, pod restart, reparenting, or exporter behavior change**, not a workload incident.  
- **Container/pod lifecycle event**: `cgroup.events.populated` and widespread shifts across all containers in the namespace fit a **rollout/restart/reschedule** moment that resets baselines and triggers CUSUM broadly.  
- **Real resource contention incident**: Presence of **CPU/IO pressure** and **CPU throttling-related stats** could indicate actual contention, but with only clustered anomaly listings (no raw time series), it’s hard to separate real contention from lifecycle/config changes.  
Uncertainty is high because the correlator is **purely time-based** (no learned causal edges), and CUSUM is sensitive to step changes (including benign config/lifecycle changes).

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Huge simultaneous cluster across containers**: `TimeCluster: 236 anomalies` including all four containers and many subsystems; `first_seen: 1769636399`, `last_updated: 1769636485`.  
- **Lifecycle signal included**: `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.populated:avg` appears for multiple containers in the same cluster.  
- **Many “settings/limits” metrics shifted** (suggesting cgroup update rather than workload):  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight:avg`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:avg`  
  - `cgroup.v2.io.weight.default:avg`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.max:avg`, `cgroup.v2.pids.max:avg`  
- **Pressure/throttling signals present but not definitive alone**: cluster contains `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`, and `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.*throttled*` metrics (not enough context to confirm user-impact).  
- **Backend-only brief CPU burst**: `TimeCluster: 10 anomalies` at `1769636511` consisting of `*_cpu_*` metrics for `todo-backend` plus `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.sock:avg`.

7) **RCA support?**  
- **No RCA section is present** in the JSON, so there are **no root candidates** to confirm or contradict the conclusion.
