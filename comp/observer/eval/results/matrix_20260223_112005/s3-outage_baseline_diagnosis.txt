============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- There is **one large time-based cluster** where **many different containers and CPU-related metrics anomalied at the same time** (within ~1s). This points to a **shared, node-level/cluster-wide event** rather than an issue isolated to a single workload.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
- **Unclear**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- N/A

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
- **Low**

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Benign synchronized workload shift / deployment / traffic pattern change:** Many anomalies are *below* baseline (CPU usage/user/system, net packets), which can happen when load drops or pods restart/roll.  
- **Node-level CPU scheduling/pressure event (real incident):** The cluster is dominated by `container.cpu.partial_stall` and includes `cpu.throttled`, which can indicate contention; but without seeing the *direction* for most of those series and without node metrics, it’s hard to confirm.  
- **Metrics/collection artifact:** Extremely high `total_anomalies` (311,883) with massive dedup skipping suggests the detector may be **over-triggering** on small sustained shifts; time clustering then groups these into a big “incident” even if it’s just widespread baseline drift.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single correlation cluster:** `total_correlations: 1` with **“TimeCluster: 2477 anomalies”** and **`source_count: 100`**, spanning many pods/containers (datadog-agent components, kube-proxy, kindnet, etcd, postgres, multiple python services).  
- **Cluster dominated by CPU signals:** sources include repeated **`container.cpu.partial_stall:avg`**, plus **`container.cpu.usage:avg`**, **`container.cpu.user:avg`**, **`container.cpu.system:avg`**, and some **`container.cpu.throttled*`**.  
- **Many sample anomalies are decreases (not spikes):** e.g. cluster-agent `container.cpu.usage:avg` **1.5σ below**, `cpu.user` **1.5σ below**, `cpu.system` **1.4σ below**; several net packet metrics also **below baseline**.  
- **Some sharp memory-related outliers exist but are not consistently dominant:** cluster-agent `container.memory.page_faults:avg` **4.6σ above** and `container.memory.usage.peak:avg` **5.0σ above** appear, but the correlated cluster shown is primarily CPU-stall oriented across many containers.

7) **RCA support?**  
- **No RCA section is present** in the JSON, so there are **no root candidates provided** to confirm or refute the conclusion.
