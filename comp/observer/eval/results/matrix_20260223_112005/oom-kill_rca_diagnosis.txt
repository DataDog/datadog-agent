============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is **one TimeCluster** where **~63 different metrics** across CPU, memory, I/O, and pids all anomalied **at essentially the same moment** for the same container/pod, indicating a single incident affecting many subsystems simultaneously (not isolated metric noise).

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container/pod experienced a **major workload/state change consistent with an OOM-related event**, with simultaneous CPU surge/throttling, sharp memory growth, and increased I/O activity.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternatives + why uncertain**  
   - **Legitimate workload spike / batch job start**: the same pattern (CPU+I/O+memory jump) can occur when a job begins or traffic suddenly increases; the data shown doesn’t include an explicit OOM kill counter or restart event.  
   - **Container restart / repopulation causing metric resets**: the cluster includes `cgroup.events.populated`, `cgroup.procs`, and `threads`, which can shift during lifecycle changes; without restart timestamps/events, it’s ambiguous.  
   Uncertainty is because the output shows **metric shifts** but not a direct “OOM kill occurred” signal (e.g., `oom_kill`, restart count, dmesg).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Single correlation: **“TimeCluster: 63 anomalies”** all tied to `container_name:oom-victim`, `pod_name:oom-kill-7f36e710`, `namespace:default`, `qos_class:Burstable`.  
   - **CPU surge**: `cpu.stat.usage_usec` shifted to **35288** (from **598**), `user_usec` to **19501** (from **330**), `system_usec` to **15786** (from **267**) (~**7.6σ**).  
   - **CPU contention/throttling**: `cpu.pressure some/full avg10` to **0.74** (from **0.04**, **4.2σ**) and `cpu.stat.local.throttled_usec` increased.  
   - **I/O spike + I/O pressure**: `io.stat.rbytes` to **1,589,248** (from **26,936**, **7.6σ**), `io.stat.rios` to **18** (from **0.31**, **7.6σ**), plus `io.pressure some/full.total` increased.  
   - **Memory jump**: `memory.current` to **20,226,048** (from **5,519,872**), `active_anon` to **20,353,024** (from **5,320,451**), `smaps_rollup.pss` to **18,763,776** (from **5,539,217**).  
   - **Process activity change**: `pids.peak` shifted to **8** (from **1.87**); cluster also includes `pids.current/max` and `cgroup.procs/threads`.

7. **RCA support?**  
   **No RCA section is present**, so there are **no RCA root candidates** to confirm or contradict the conclusion.
