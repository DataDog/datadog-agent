============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

Be concise. Answer: 1. What do correlations mean? 2. Problem? 3. What? 4. Confidence 5. If uncertain, alternatives? 6. Evidence

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- There is **one dominant time cluster** where **66 different metrics** from the same workload anomalied **at the same time**, indicating a **single incident affecting CPU, memory, I/O, and process/thread counts simultaneously** (i.e., not isolated noise).

2) **Is there a problem?**  
- **Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- The `crasher` container/pod appears to enter a bursty/failing state consistent with a **crash-loop or fork/threads explosion causing CPU throttling/pressure, memory growth, and I/O activity**.

4) **Confidence level**  
- **Medium.**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Instrumentation/metadata churn**: some anomalous fields look like configuration/boolean-ish values (`cpu.weight`, `pids.max`, `cgroup.events.populated`) shifting, which can happen when cgroups are recreated during restarts rather than due to resource consumption alone.  
- **Container restart/recreation event**: `populated` changing and many cgroup stats shifting together can reflect a **new container instance** inheriting different limits/weights, not purely an application fault.  
- Uncertain because we don’t see explicit **restart counters / OOM kill events / exit codes**, and the correlator is **TimeCluster only** (no learned causal edges).

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single simultaneous cluster:** “TimeCluster: 66 anomalies” for the same pod/container (`container_name:crasher`, `pod_name:crash-loop-2ad3b6ae`, `namespace:default`).  
- **Process/thread explosion signals:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads:avg` shifted to **13085** (baseline **2475**).  
- **CPU contention/throttling:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.total` shifted to **159266** (baseline **30131**); `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.local.throttled_usec` shifted to **319029** (baseline **60356**); cluster includes `nr_throttled`, `throttled_usec`, `usage_usec`.  
- **Memory growth:** `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg` shifted to **7,991,296** (baseline **1,511,866**); `smaps_rollup.rss:avg` to **12,423,168** (baseline **2,350,329**); `memory.stat.anon` to **7,262,208** (baseline **1,373,931**).  
- **I/O activity/pressure:** `io.stat.rios` and `io.stat.rbytes` shift up; `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.total` shifted to **40** (baseline **7.57**).  
- **Lifecycle/restart hint:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.populated:avg` shifted to **1.00** (baseline **0.19**) (often aligns with cgroup becoming populated during (re)start).

7) **RCA support**  
- **No RCA section is present** in the JSON, so there are **no root-candidate outputs to confirm or contradict** this conclusion.
