This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What the correlations tell you**
- **time_cluster_1 (236 series, confidence 0.49):** A broad, near-simultaneous shift across many **CPU, I/O, memory, PSI/pressure, pids** metrics spanning multiple containers, with the **earliest onsets** on the **cleanup** container’s CPU usage and read I/O; effects appear to spread to other pods (e.g., todo-backend).
- **time_cluster_2 (10 series, confidence 0.25):** A smaller, single-timestamp cluster isolated to **todo-backend**, tying **socket memory (sock)** and **CPU utilization** anomalies together.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
A **cluster-wide resource contention event** (CPU + disk read I/O surge) likely initiated by the **cleanup** container, coinciding with widespread pressure/usage shifts across other containers, plus a secondary **todo-backend CPU + socket-memory spike**.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Medium** (bordering low for precise causality).

5) **Alternative possibilities / why uncertain**
- **Common external trigger rather than cleanup “causing” others:** Many metric families across multiple pods shift together; TimeCluster groups by simultaneity and the flags say directionality is weak, so the “root” may just be an early indicator.
- **Instrumentation / baseline artifact:** CUSUM learns baseline from first 25%—if workload changed phase, it can label the new steady state as anomalous en masse (explains the huge anomaly count and many families moving together).
- **Node-level throttling / cgroup config change:** Anomalies include **cpu.weight / io.weight.default / pids.max** families across containers; if these are derived/collected oddly or changed at once, they could reflect policy updates rather than true saturation.
- **Cleanup doing heavy disk scanning/reads while other pods naturally scale at same time:** The evidence path is only temporal (1 hop), not a learned dependency (no GraphSketch edges here), so causation remains ambiguous.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**
- **time_cluster_1 key sources all on cleanup container (BestEffort) and earliest onset (T=1769636452):**
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec` shifted to **27513** (**4.4σ** above **1353** baseline).
  - `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rbytes` shifted to **81920** (**4.4σ** above **4028** baseline).
  - `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rios` shifted to **5.00** (**4.4σ** above **0.25** baseline).
- **Breadth of affected families in time_cluster_1 (236 series):** CPU pressure (some/full totals), IO pressure (some/full totals), memory current/peak/stat anon/file, smaps rss/pss/private_dirty, pids metrics, etc. → consistent with “system under load/phase shift.”
- **Cross-container temporal linkage in RCA evidence paths:** cleanup (`cpu.usage_usec` / `io.rbytes` / `io.rios`) → todo-backend `io.rbytes` (temporal path score ~0.895).
- **time_cluster_2 (todo-backend only, T=1769636511):**
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.sock` is top candidate (peak sigma **1.00**) along with `cpu_percentage` / `total_cpu_percentage` (peak sigma **0.88**).

7) **Do the RCA/digest key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**
- **Partially yes.** The digest/RCA **do support** that the event’s **earliest anomalous signals** are **cleanup CPU usage + read I/O** (the onset chain is exactly those three at the same onset time), aligning with “resource surge starts there.”
- **But not fully for strict causality.** The confidence flags (**weak_directionality, ambiguous_roots**) and modest RCA scores (0.49 / 0.25) mean the onset ordering could be coincidental or driven by a shared upstream factor, so the conclusion is “contention/phase shift occurred,” with the cleanup container as a plausible trigger/indicator rather than proven root cause.
