============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   A single large **simultaneous anomaly cluster** (63 metrics within ~1s) occurred for the `oom-victim` container, spanning **cgroup population/procs/threads**, **CPU usage + CPU pressure + throttling**, **memory growth (RSS/PSS/anon/file/kernel)**, and **I/O activity + I/O pressure**—i.e., a container-wide resource disturbance rather than one isolated metric.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container experienced a **sustained resource surge** (CPU + memory increase with CPU throttling/pressure and elevated I/O), consistent with a workload spike or runaway process that could lead to instability/oom conditions.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low** (RCA confidence is 0.25 with flags).

5. **If not high confidence: alternatives + why uncertain**  
   - **Container restart / (re)population event**: `cgroup.events.populated` and `cgroup.procs` are top “roots” but these can be *state transitions* that coincide with metric resets/step-changes rather than the cause of resource pressure.  
   - **Measurement/aggregation artifact from CUSUM baseline**: CUSUM learns baseline from the first 25% and flags sustained shifts; if the “normal” period was idle and the container later did normal work, it can look anomalous.  
   - **Node-level contention or CPU quota changes**: CPU pressure + throttling could be driven by external contention/limits rather than the container itself; directionality is marked weak.  
   Uncertainty is explicitly indicated by **`weak_directionality`** and **`ambiguous_roots`**, and because **TimeCluster** groups by simultaneity (not learned causality).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - One correlation: **`time_cluster_379` with 63 anomalous series** (container `oom-victim`, pod `oom-kill-7f36e710`, Burstable).  
   - **CPU spike**: `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec` 7.6σ above baseline; `user_usec` and `system_usec` also 7.6σ.  
   - **CPU contention/throttling**: `cpu.pressure.some/full.avg10` 4.2σ; `cpu.stat.local.throttled_usec` elevated; `nr_periods` elevated.  
   - **Memory increase**: `memory.current` up (~5.5MB → ~20MB); `smaps_rollup.pss` and `active_anon` elevated.  
   - **I/O increase and pressure**: `io.stat.rbytes` 7.6σ; `io.stat.rios` 7.6σ; `io.pressure.*.total` elevated.  
   - **Process/cgroup state included in cluster**: `cgroup.events.populated`, `cgroup.procs`, `cgroup.threads` are part of the same time cluster.

7. **Do the RCA/digest key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**  
   **Partially.** The digest/RCA’s **key sources** (`cgroup.events.populated`, `cgroup.pressure`, `cgroup.procs`) and the **onset chain** (all at the same timestamp) support that this was a **container-wide event affecting many subsystems at once**, but they **do not strongly support a specific causal root** (RCA confidence 0.25; flags: weak directionality, ambiguous roots).
