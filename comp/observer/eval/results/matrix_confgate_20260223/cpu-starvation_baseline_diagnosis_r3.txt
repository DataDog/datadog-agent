============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   A single TimeCluster groups **66 metrics** that all shifted abnormally **at the same time (within ~1s)** for the same workload (`container_name:crasher`, `pod_name:crash-loop-2ad3b6ae`, `namespace:default`), indicating a coordinated event affecting CPU, memory, pids/threads, and I/O rather than isolated noise.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The `crasher` container/pod experienced a sudden sustained load spike consistent with a **runaway/crash-looping process that rapidly increased threads/PIDs and drove CPU pressure/throttling plus elevated memory and I/O activity**.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Container restart/recreation artifact:** cgroup “populated” flipping and many cgroup knobs/statistics shifting together can happen around restarts; without explicit restart count/events, causality is uncertain.  
   - **Resource limit/config change (CPU shares/weights, limits):** anomalies include `cpu.weight` and `pids.max`, which could reflect config/metric encoding changes rather than pure workload behavior.  
   - **Instrumentation/collection issue:** extremely large `total_anomalies` with heavy dedup (`dedup_skipped: 190030`) suggests repeated detections; could amplify a short incident or reflect reporting quirks.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlated incident:** `total_correlations: 1` with **TimeCluster: 66 anomalies** all tied to the same container/pod.  
   - **CPU contention/throttling:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.total` shifted up (e.g., **159266 vs 30131 baseline**), and `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.*throttled_usec` shifted up (**319029 vs 60356 baseline**).  
   - **Process explosion indicators:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads` shifted up (**13085 vs 2475 baseline**); `cgroup.v2.pids.max` shifted up (**2135 vs 403 baseline**) and cluster includes `pids.current/peak` and `container.pid_count`.  
   - **Memory jump:** `cgroup.v2.memory.current` shifted up (**7,991,296 vs 1,511,866 baseline**); `smaps_rollup.rss` shifted up (**12,423,168 vs 2,350,329 baseline**); `memory.stat.anon` increased.  
   - **I/O increase & pressure:** `io.stat.rios` and `io.stat.rbytes` increased; cluster includes `io.pressure` and write metrics.  
   - **Cgroup lifecycle signal:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.populated` shifted up (**1.00 vs 0.19 baseline**), consistent with the cgroup becoming active (e.g., container running/restarting).

7. **RCA/digest present? Do key sources/onset chain support conclusion?**  
   **No RCA/digest section is present**, so there is **no explicit onset chain to confirm**; the correlated key sources (threads/PIDs, CPU pressure/throttling, memory/I/O jumps) **are consistent with** the conclusion but don’t uniquely prove crash-loop vs restart/config-change.
