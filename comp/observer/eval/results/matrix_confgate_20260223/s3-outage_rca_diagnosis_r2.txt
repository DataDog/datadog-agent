This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is one large, tightly time-aligned incident window (~24s) where **hundreds of metrics across many families** anomalied together: kubelet runtime operation metrics, **node/filesystem disk space metrics**, and broad **container CPU/memory/IO/network** signals—suggesting a **node-level event** affecting many containers at once rather than a single app-only issue.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   A short node-wide disruption consistent with **storage/filesystem pressure or I/O disturbance** that coincided with widespread kubelet runtime-operation anomalies and broad container resource anomalies.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (since not high confidence)**  
   - **Kubelet/container-runtime hiccup or control-plane/agent instrumentation artifact**: many kubelet runtime operation metrics (87 series) moved together, and the digest flags **ambiguous_roots** with low RCA confidence, so causality direction is unclear.  
   - **System-wide CPU contention / scheduling stalls**: many `container.cpu.*` and `partial_stall` series co-occur; could drive downstream kubelet/runtime delays without disk being the primary cause.  
   - **Ephemeral storage accounting/mount changes (not real disk pressure)**: simultaneous anomalies in `system.disk.free/used/in_use/utilized` across devices (including `/dev/termination-log`) can happen due to mount/metrics collection changes.  
   Uncertainty is mainly because the correlator is **TimeCluster (no learned causation)** and the digest explicitly says **RCA confidence is low (0.53) and causal ordering is uncertain**.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single huge cluster:** `TimeCluster: 897 anomalies`, spanning **132 unique metric sources** overall.  
   - **Disk space metrics heavily represented:** `system.disk.free/in_use/used/utilized: 29 series each` in the cluster.  
   - **Kubelet runtime ops breadth:** `kubernetes.kubelet.runtime.operations.duration.count:avg: 87 series` (dominant family in digest).  
   - **Broad container stress signals:** multiple families present simultaneously (examples from digest counts):  
     - CPU: `container.cpu.usage/user/system` and `container.cpu.partial_stall` (17–18 series each)  
     - Memory faults: `container.memory.page_faults` (21), `major_page_faults` (11)  
     - Container/runtime uptimes: `container.uptime` (21), `containerd.uptime` (21), `cri.uptime` (21)  
   - **Time window:** correlation `first_seen=1771417694`, `last_updated=1771417718` (~24 seconds).

7. **Do RCA/digest key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**  
   - **Key sources (digest):** They emphasize **kubelet runtime operation duration count** and **system.disk.* metrics** as the most impacted families, which **supports** a node-level event involving kubelet/runtime plus filesystem signals.  
   - **Onset chain:** `onset_chain: null`, so there is **no directional sequence** to validate causality.  
   - **RCA ranked roots:** present but **not reliable for causation here** because the digest flags **ambiguous_roots** and `rca_confidence ~0.53`; the specific “containerd.blkio… as root” suggestion is **compatible** with an I/O disturbance hypothesis but **does not strongly support it** given the low-confidence/ambiguous directionality.
