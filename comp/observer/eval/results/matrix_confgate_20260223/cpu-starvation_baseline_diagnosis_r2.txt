============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
A single TimeCluster groups **66 different metrics** that all became anomalous **at the same time (within ~1s)** for the same workload (`container_name:crasher`, `pod_name:crash-loop-2ad3b6ae`, `namespace:default`), indicating a **single, coordinated event** impacting CPU, memory, PIDs/threads, and I/O simultaneously (not independent noise).

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
The `crasher` container/pod appears to enter a crash-loop / runaway process-fork + resource surge episode causing **massive thread/PID growth plus CPU throttling/pressure, memory growth, and increased I/O**.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Medium**.

5) **If not high confidence: alternatives + why uncertain**  
- **Intentional load test / “chaos” container behavior**: the name `crasher` and `crash-loop-*` suggests the behavior may be deliberate; metrics alone can’t confirm it’s unintended.  
- **Container restart/recreation artifacts**: `cgroup.events.populated` shifting toward 1 and many cgroup metrics moving together can happen around start/stop; without restart counters/logs we can’t prove “failure” vs “new steady state.”  
- **Metrics/collection or dedup artifact**: extremely high `total_anomalies` with huge `dedup_skipped` implies many repeated detections after a baseline shift; could exaggerate incident severity though the shift is still real.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Simultaneous multi-metric cluster**: `TimeCluster: 66 anomalies`, `first_seen: 1769630443`, `last_updated: 1769630485`, all for the same container/pod.  
- **PID/thread explosion**: `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads` shifted to **13085** from baseline **2475**; `pids.max` shifted to **2135** from **404**; cluster includes `pids.current`, `pids.peak`, `container.pid_count`.  
- **CPU contention/throttling**: `cpu.pressure.full.total` shifted to **159266** from **30131**; `cpu.stat.local.throttled_usec` shifted to **319029** from **60357**; cluster includes `nr_throttled`, `throttled_usec`, CPU usage/percent metrics.  
- **Memory growth**: `memory.current` shifted to **7,991,296** from **1,511,867**; `smaps_rollup.rss` shifted to **12,423,168** from **2,350,329**; `memory.stat.anon` up (~**7.26MB** vs **1.37MB**), plus slab/file_dirty increases.  
- **I/O increase and I/O pressure**: `io.stat.rios` shifted to **6.00** from **0.30**; `io.stat.rbytes` shifted to **86016** from **4230**; `io.pressure.full.total` shifted to **40** from **7.57**.  
- **Lifecycle signal**: `cgroup.events.populated` shifted to **1.00** from **0.19** (more consistently “populated”).

7) **RCA/digest present? do key sources/onset chain support conclusion?**  
**No RCA/digest is present** in the JSON, so there is **no explicit ranked onset chain to validate**; the TimeCluster’s key sources (PIDs/threads + CPU pressure/throttling + memory + I/O) **are consistent** with the stated conclusion.
