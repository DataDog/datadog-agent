============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   - **time_cluster_1:** A large, near-simultaneous event affecting **many containers/series (236)** across **CPU pressure/throttling, memory growth/pressure (anon/rss/pss, slab), I/O pressure and I/O stats, and pids/cgroup state**—i.e., a broad **system-wide contention / resource pressure episode**, not a single-metric blip.  
   - **time_cluster_2:** A smaller, later micro-burst (**10 series**) isolated to **todo-backend**, combining **CPU usage spike** with **memory sock** anomaly.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   A short incident of **cluster/node resource contention (CPU + memory + I/O pressure) impacting multiple containers at once**, consistent with a heavy workload or disruptive background job.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium** (pattern is strong, but causal direction/root is unclear).

5. **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (if not high confidence)**  
   - **Instrumentation/config change** (e.g., changes to cgroup weights/limits/collection) could create many “shifts” at once; uncertainty because CUSUM flags sustained baseline shifts and we see anomalies in “weight” metrics too.  
   - **Coordinated workload step/change** (deployment/traffic surge/load test) rather than “fault”; uncertainty because we lack external context (events, rollouts, node-level saturation).  
   - **Single noisy container causing node-level contention** (e.g., cleanup job) vs **shared-node issue**; uncertainty because TimeCluster groups by time, not causality, and RCA confidence flags *weak_directionality/ambiguous_roots*.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **236 anomalous series** in **time_cluster_1** with very broad metric-family coverage:  
     - CPU pressure: `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.total`, `...some.total`, plus `nr_periods/nr_throttled/throttled_usec/usage_usec` families.  
     - I/O pressure + I/O activity: `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*.total`, `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rbytes/rios/wbytes/wios`.  
     - Memory pressure/growth: `cgroup.v2.memory.current/peak`, `memory.stat.anon/active_anon/file/slab_*`, plus smaps `rss/pss/private_dirty`.  
     - Process/cgroup activity: `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.populated`, `pids.current/peak`, `container.pid_count`.  
   - Sample anomalies show **large sustained shifts** (CUSUM):  
     - `smaps_rollup.private_dirty` ~**17.9M** vs baseline **2.94M** (todo-frontend).  
     - `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.some.total` **32613** vs **7119** (todo-backend).  
     - `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rbytes` **81920** vs **4028** and `rios` **5** vs **0.25** (cleanup).  
   - **time_cluster_2** is localized to one container (`todo-backend`) and is mostly CPU metrics + `memory.stat.sock`.

7. **Do RCA/digest key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**  
   - **Digest supports** the conclusion: the **metric family breadth** in **time_cluster_1** clearly indicates **multi-resource pressure** across multiple containers at the same time.  
   - **RCA series rankings do not strongly support a specific root cause** (digest explicitly says **RCA confidence low**, flags **weak_directionality/ambiguous_roots**, and **onset_chain is null**), so they **do not justify attributing causation** to the “cleanup” container—only that it was involved early in the cluster.
