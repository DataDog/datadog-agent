PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is **one single time cluster** where **many (63) different metrics anomalied essentially simultaneously**, all tagged to the same container/pod, indicating a **single incident affecting CPU, memory, and I/O at once** rather than unrelated independent anomalies.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container `oom-victim` in pod `oom-kill-7f36e710` experienced a **sustained resource-event consistent with an OOM/near-OOM condition with concurrent CPU and I/O pressure**, i.e., a workload blow-up leading to memory growth and system stress.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Intentional load test / benchmark spike:** the pod name (`oom-kill-*`) suggests a deliberate scenario; without explicit `oom_kill` counters/logs, it could be a planned stress run rather than an unexpected fault.  
   - **Container restart/teardown artifact:** simultaneous anomalies across many “current/peak/populated/procs/threads” style metrics can happen around lifecycle transitions; we don’t see explicit restart timestamps/events here.  
   - **Normal baseline mismatch:** CUSUM learns baseline from first 25%—if that baseline captured an idle period and later the app simply started doing real work, the “shift” could be normal for that workload.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlated incident:** `TimeCluster: 63 anomalies` with `first_seen == last_updated == 1769633613` (one onset moment).  
   - **Memory jump:** `cgroup.v2.memory.current` shifted from ~5.5MB baseline to ~20.2MB; `smaps_rollup.pss` ~5.5MB → ~18.8MB; `memory.stat.active_anon` ~5.3MB → ~20.4MB.  
   - **CPU surge + contention:** `cpu.stat.usage_usec` ~598 → ~35,288; `user_usec` ~331 → ~19,501; `system_usec` ~268 → ~15,786; plus **CPU pressure** (`cpu.pressure.some/full.avg10` 0.04 → 0.74) and **throttling** (`local.throttled_usec` elevated).  
   - **I/O surge + pressure:** `io.stat.rbytes` ~26,936 → ~1,589,248 and `io.stat.rios` 0.31 → 18; `io.pressure.*.total` increased.  
   - **Pod/container context strongly suggests OOM scenario:** tags show `container_name:oom-victim`, `pod_name:oom-kill-7f36e710`.

7. **RCA/digest present? Do key sources/onset chain support conclusion?**  
   **No RCA field is present** in this JSON, so there is **no explicit ranked root-cause chain to confirm**; the conclusion is based on the **time-clustered multi-resource anomalies and the “oom-*” naming/tags**.
