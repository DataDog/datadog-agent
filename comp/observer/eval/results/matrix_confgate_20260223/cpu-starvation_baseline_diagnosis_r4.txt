============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is a single TimeCluster where **~66 different metrics from the same container/pod** anomalied essentially simultaneously (within ~1s), indicating a **coordinated event** affecting CPU, memory, pids/threads, and I/O for that container rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The `crasher` container in pod `crash-loop-2ad3b6ae` experienced a sustained resource blow-up (process/thread explosion with rising memory and CPU pressure/throttling plus elevated I/O), consistent with a crash-loop or runaway workload.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Intentional load/crash test** (name `crasher`, pod name contains `crash-loop`): could be synthetic, not an unexpected incident.  
   - **Baseline/training artifact** (CUSUM learns from first 25%): if the “normal” period didn’t include typical workload phases, CUSUM may flag a legitimate step-change as anomalous.  
   - **Container restart/replica change effects**: `cgroup.events.populated` shifting upward and many limits/peaks changing could reflect lifecycle changes rather than pure resource leak.  
   Uncertainty stems from lack of explicit restart events/logs and the fact that the correlator is only time-based (no learned causal edges).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single tight cluster:** `TimeCluster: 66 anomalies`, `first_seen: 1769630443`, `last_updated: 1769630485`, all for the same `container_name:crasher`, `pod_name:crash-loop-2ad3b6ae`, `namespace:default`.  
   - **Process/thread explosion indicators:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads:avg shifted to 13085 (baseline 2475)`, plus anomalies in `cgroup.procs`, `pids.current/max/peak`, and `container.pid_count`.  
   - **Memory jump:** `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg shifted to 7,991,296 (baseline 1,511,866)`; `smaps_rollup.rss:avg shifted to 12,423,168 (baseline 2,350,329)`; `memory.stat.anon` also jumps.  
   - **CPU contention/throttling:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.total:avg shifted to 159,266 (baseline 30,131)` and `cpu.stat.*throttled_usec` elevated; cluster includes many `cpu.pressure.*` and `cpu.stat.*` metrics.  
   - **I/O activity/pressure increase:** `io.stat.rbytes` and `io.stat.rios` shift up; cluster includes `io.stat.wbytes/wios` and `io.pressure.full.total`.  
   - **Magnitude/scale:** very large total anomalies (`total_anomalies: 193855`) with heavy dedup (`dedup_skipped: 190030`) suggests the shift persisted and kept triggering.

7. **RCA/digest present? Do key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**  
   **No RCA/digest is present** in the provided JSON, so there is **no explicit onset chain** to confirm; the **key sources in the TimeCluster and sample anomalies do support** the “runaway/crash-loop resource surge” conclusion via simultaneous CPU+memory+pids/threads+I/O shifts.
