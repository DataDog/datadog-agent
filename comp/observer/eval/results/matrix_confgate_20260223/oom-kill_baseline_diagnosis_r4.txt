============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All anomalous metrics collapse into **one simultaneous time cluster** (63 sources) for a single container/pod, meaning CPU, memory, I/O, pressure, and pids signals all shifted together—consistent with one incident affecting the whole cgroup.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The **oom-victim** container experienced a sustained step-up in resource usage and contention (CPU + I/O + memory growth with throttling/pressure), consistent with an **OOM/near-OOM workload surge or runaway process**.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Legitimate workload phase change / load test**: CUSUM flags sustained baseline shifts; a planned traffic increase would look similar.  
   - **Container restart / cgroup repopulation artifact**: cluster includes `cgroup.events.populated`, `cgroup.procs/threads`, which can jump on start/stop; without explicit OOM-kill counter/events shown, causality isn’t certain.  
   - **Node-level I/O contention** affecting this container: PSI I/O (`io.pressure.*`) rises with increased `rbytes/rios`, but we can’t see other pods/node metrics to confirm shared contention.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Single correlated incident: **TimeCluster: 63 anomalies**, `first_seen=last_updated=1769633613`, all tagged to `pod_name:oom-kill-7f36e710`, `container_name:oom-victim`, QoS **Burstable**.  
   - Large sustained CPU shift: `cpu.stat.usage_usec` **7.6σ**, `user_usec` **7.6σ**, `system_usec` **7.6σ** above baseline.  
   - CPU contention: `cpu.pressure.some.avg10` and `cpu.pressure.full.avg10` to **0.74 (4.2σ)**; throttling up (`cpu.stat.local.throttled_usec` 1.8σ, `nr_periods` 1.6σ).  
   - I/O surge + I/O pressure: `io.stat.rbytes` **7.6σ**, `io.stat.rios` **7.6σ**; `io.pressure.some/full.total` increased (1.8σ).  
   - Memory step-up: `memory.current` ~**20MB vs 5.5MB** baseline (1.5σ); `memory.stat.active_anon` ~**20MB vs 5.3MB** baseline; `smaps_rollup.pss` ~**18.8MB vs 5.5MB** baseline.  
   - Process activity increased: `pids.peak` shifted to **8 vs 1.87** baseline (1.8σ).

7. **RCA/digest present? do key sources/onset chain support conclusion?**  
   **No RCA field is present**, so there’s **no explicit onset chain** to validate; the **key sources in the time cluster (CPU+throttling/PSI, memory.current/active_anon/PSS, io rbytes/rios + io PSI, pids)** do support the conclusion of a coordinated resource surge/contended cgroup, but they don’t prove an actual OOM kill event by themselves.
