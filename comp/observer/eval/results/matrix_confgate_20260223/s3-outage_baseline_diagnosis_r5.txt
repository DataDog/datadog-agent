============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is **one large simultaneous “incident window”** where **many CPU scheduling metrics** (notably `container.cpu.partial_stall`, plus CPU usage/system and throttling metrics) anomalied **at the same timestamps across many different containers/pods**—i.e., a **cluster-wide, node-level event** rather than an isolated container issue.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low** (leaning “likely benign/measurement-artifact or systemic blip,” but not provable from this output alone).

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Node-level CPU pressure / scheduler contention** (real): widespread `container.cpu.partial_stall` across many workloads can indicate CPU starvation or host contention, but we don’t see corroborating host metrics here (run queue, node CPU saturation, load avg, etc.).  
   - **Instrumentation / collection artifact**: CUSUM is flagging many **small “below baseline” shifts** (e.g., 1–2σ) and even **uptime** deltas; a scrape timing change, restart, or baseline/training mismatch can create mass “shift” detections without a true incident.  
   - **Workload phase change / coordinated traffic drop**: many CPU/memory values shift *down* together, consistent with a global load reduction rather than failure.  
   Uncertain because the correlator is **TimeCluster only** (no learned causal edges) and the sample anomalies are dominated by modest “shifted below baseline” messages, which can be either real change or detector sensitivity/baseline drift.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster**: `total_correlations: 1` with **“TimeCluster: 2545 anomalies”** (`first_seen: 1771417694`, `last_updated: 1771418040`).  
   - Cluster sources heavily feature **CPU stall/scheduling metrics across many containers**: repeated `demo|container.cpu.partial_stall:avg|...` for `trace-agent`, `aws-lambda`, `kube-proxy`, `postgres`, `etcd`, `kindnet-cni`, multiple python services, Datadog agents, etc.  
   - Same cluster includes **CPU usage/system** metrics (`demo|container.cpu.system:avg|...`, `demo|container.cpu.usage:avg|...`) and **throttling** metrics (`demo|container.cpu.throttled:avg`, `...throttled.periods:avg`) across system and app pods.  
   - Sample CUSUM anomalies show many metrics **shifting slightly below baseline** (e.g., `containerd.mem.current.usage` 2.1σ below, `containerd.proc.open_fds` 2.2σ below, `cri.cpu.usage` ~1.5–2.1σ below) rather than extreme spikes.  
   - Presence of **uptime “shifted below baseline”** anomalies (`cri.uptime`, `containerd.uptime`) suggests **possible timing/baseline effects** rather than a pure resource failure signal.

7. **RCA/digest present? Do key sources/onset chain support the conclusion?**  
   **No RCA section is present** in the JSON, so there is **no explicit ranked root-cause chain** to confirm or refute the above; the TimeCluster correlation alone supports only “many things happened at once,” not a definitive cause.
