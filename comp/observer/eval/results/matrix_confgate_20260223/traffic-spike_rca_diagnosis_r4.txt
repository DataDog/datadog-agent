This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- **time_cluster_1:** A large, near-simultaneous anomaly burst across **many metric families (CPU pressure/throttling, IO pressure + IO stats, memory current/peak + many memory.stat + smaps, pids, plus cgroup “populated/pressure”)** and across **multiple containers** (cleanup, todo-frontend, todo-backend, todo-redis). This looks like a **system-wide disturbance** rather than a single-metric blip.  
- **time_cluster_2:** A small, single-timestamp cluster isolated to **todo-backend** with **CPU usage% (user/system/kernel/total)** and **memory.stat.sock** moving together—consistent with a brief backend-local CPU event (with some kernel/socket activity).

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
A short incident of **node-level resource contention** (IO + CPU pressure with broad memory activity) affecting multiple containers at once, likely triggered by a bursty workload (e.g., cleanup/job activity) rather than a clean single-service regression.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Low–Medium** (overall **low** for pinpointing a single root; **medium** that “shared contention/event” happened).

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Measurement/collection artifact or baseline shift:** CUSUM flags sustained shifts; if the “normal” first-25% window differs (startup/warmup), many series can shift together. Uncertain because the cluster includes **configuration-like metrics** (e.g., cpu.weight, io.weight) that usually don’t all change in real incidents.  
- **Container churn / pod lifecycle event:** Presence of **cgroup.events.populated** and broad multi-metric shifts could reflect containers starting/stopping or being recreated, producing step-changes across many stats. Uncertain because we don’t see explicit lifecycle timestamps beyond the anomaly times.  
- **Real IO-heavy job causing cascading pressure:** Cleanup container shows early strong IO read/ops and CPU usage; this could saturate disk, raising **io.pressure** and indirectly CPU pressure and memory reclaim/cache activity in peers. Uncertain because digest flags **weak directionality / ambiguous roots** and no onset chain is established.  
- **Memory pressure / OOM-related behavior:** **memory.oom.group** anomalies appear, but not enough detail to confirm actual OOM kills vs just thresholded/changed values.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **time_cluster_1 is huge:** “**236 anomalous series**”, spanning **~79 unique sources overall**.  
- **Breadth across subsystems:** Digest lists families for **CPU pressure (some/full, totals/avg*)**, **IO pressure (some/full)**, **IO stats (rbytes/rios/wbytes/wios)**, **memory current/peak/max + many memory.stat counters**, **smaps_rollup rss/pss/private_dirty/etc**, and **pids**.  
- **Multi-container impact:** Sources explicitly include **cleanup (BestEffort)** and **todo-* (Burstable)** containers in the same time cluster.  
- **Concrete early strong shifts in sample anomalies:** cleanup shows **io.stat.rbytes and rios** and **cpu.stat.usage_usec** shifting ~**4.4σ** above baseline at the same timestamp (1769636453).  
- **time_cluster_2 is localized:** “**10 anomalous series**” all for **todo-backend**, all at **1769636511**, mostly CPU% metrics plus **memory.stat.sock**.

7) **Do RCA/digest key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**  
- **Digest:** Yes—its emphasis is on **wide metric-family breadth** and **simultaneous anomalies**, which supports the conclusion of a **shared contention/system-wide event** rather than a narrow fault.  
- **RCA + onset chain:** The **onset_chain is null** and both clusters have **low RCA confidence** with flags (**weak_directionality, ambiguous_roots**). So the specific ranked “root candidates” **do not strongly support a single-cause claim**, but the presence of early **cleanup CPU/IO shifts** is **consistent with** (not proof of) a bursty workload contributing to broader contention.
