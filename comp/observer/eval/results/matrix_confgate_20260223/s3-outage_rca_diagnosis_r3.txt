============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What the correlations tell you?**  
A single large, time-aligned incident window (~24s) where **hundreds of metrics across the node and many containers** anomalied together: kubelet runtime operation metrics, **node filesystem/disk space metrics**, broad **container/containerd/CRI CPU**, memory (incl. **page faults**), I/O and network.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
**Low** (digest RCA confidence ~0.53, flagged ambiguous_roots).

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Real node-level resource event (disk pressure / I/O contention / filesystem shift)**: disk free/used/in_use/utilized all anomalied across many devices at the same time, and kubelet runtime ops metrics spiked—consistent with node/storage disturbance.  
- **Kubelet/container runtime churn (container status/listing storm, restarts, or control-plane hiccup)**: 87 series of `kubernetes.kubelet.runtime.operations.duration.count` is unusually broad and could reflect systemic kubelet/runtime behavior rather than an app fault.  
- **Instrumentation/collection artifact**: extremely broad cross-family anomalies within 1s can occur if scraping/aggregation changed, a clock/uptime discontinuity happened, or a daemonset/agent behavior changed.  
Uncertain because the correlator is **TimeCluster (no learned causality)** and the digest explicitly says causal ordering is uncertain; CUSUM also flags sustained shifts that may be benign step changes.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **One correlation only**: `time_cluster_1` with **897 anomalous series**; `first_seen=1771417694`, `last_updated=1771417718`.  
- **Very broad metric-family footprint** (digest):  
  - Kubelet runtime ops: `kubernetes.kubelet.runtime.operations.duration.count:avg` **87 series**.  
  - Node disk space: `system.disk.free/in_use/used/utilized:avg` **29 series each** (multiple devices incl `/` and `/dev/termination-log`).  
  - Container CPU: `container.cpu.user/usage/system/partial_stall` (17–18 series each) + corresponding `containerd.*` and `cri.*`.  
  - Memory pressure signals: `container.memory.page_faults` **21 series**, `major_page_faults` **11**, plus `kernel/working_set/usage`.  
- Sample anomalies show **simultaneous CPU and memory shifts** in multiple pods (datadog-agent trace-agent; python services) and **large page-fault jumps** (e.g., 75σ).

7) **Do key sources / onset chain support the conclusion?**  
- **Key sources support “broad, simultaneous node-wide disturbance,”** because they highlight the *breadth* (kubelet runtime ops + disk metrics) rather than a single container.  
- **Onset chain:** `null` in the digest, so **there’s no directional sequence** to confirm a specific root cause.  
- **RCA ranking:** present but **not reliable for causation here** (digest confidence 0.53, `ambiguous_roots`), so it does **not** strongly support a specific “containerd blkio write” root—only that I/O/CPU shifts occurred early in the window.
