This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- **time_cluster_1:** A broad, simultaneous anomaly involving **67 metric families** across **memory (smaps + cgroup memory.stat), CPU (usage + pressure + throttling), I/O (rbytes/rios/wbytes + IO pressure), and pids/threads/procs** in the same container. This looks like a **major container state change / workload shift** rather than an isolated metric blip.  
- **time_cluster_2:** A later, smaller cluster of **7 CPU-only metrics** (total/system/kernel CPU %) at a single moment, consistent with a **CPU surge** (possibly as part of the same event or a follow-on effect).

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
The container likely experienced a **sustained resource event dominated by sharp memory growth/pressure with accompanying CPU and I/O activity** (consistent with a memory-leak / memory-driven thrash pattern in `leaky-app`).

4) **Confidence level**  
**Medium** (RCA confidence in digest is low, but the multi-subsystem breadth is strong).

5) **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (since not high confidence)**  
- **Container start/restart or configuration change** (many “limit/weight/max” and cgroup-related metrics shifting together can happen at lifecycle transitions); uncertainty because **TimeCluster** only groups by simultaneity and the digest flags **weak_directionality / ambiguous_roots**.  
- **Traffic/load step change** causing higher working set, more file cache/dirty pages, and more I/O; uncertainty because we don’t see app-level request metrics and **CUSUM** will fire on sustained shifts regardless of cause.  
- **Kernel reclaim / writeback episode** (file_dirty + I/O changes could be writeback-driven); uncertainty because we lack direct writeback/flush timing and the onset chain is null.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Very large anomaly breadth:** `time_cluster_1` has **67 anomalous series** spanning memory, CPU, I/O, and pids/threads.  
- **Memory footprint jump (smaps):** `smaps_rollup.pss` shifted to **13.3MB vs 3.08MB baseline**, plus `pss_dirty`, `pss_file`, `rss` also anomalous.  
- **Kernel/cgroup memory growth:** `cgroup.v2.memory.current`, `memory.stat.anon/active_anon`, `slab`, `slab_reclaimable`, `pagetables`, `kernel_stack` all shifted upward together.  
- **I/O activity spike:** `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rbytes` **1,662,976 vs 81,786 baseline (4.4σ)** and `rios` **20 vs 0.98 (4.4σ)**; also `wbytes` is implicated by RCA evidence paths.  
- **CPU involvement + pressure:** multiple `cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_percentage`, plus `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*` and `cpu.stat.*` present in the cluster; separate `time_cluster_2` is CPU-only at a later timestamp.  
- **Process/thread count anomalies:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads` and `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs` shifted to **32327 vs 6593 baseline** (as reported).

7) **Do RCA/digest key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**  
- **Key sources:** Yes **in the sense of breadth**—the digest’s representative families include **smaps rss/pss, cpu %, CPU pressure, pgmajfault, slab_reclaimable, pid_count**, matching the “memory + CPU + I/O + pids” hypothesis.  
- **Onset chain:** **Not available (null)**, so it **does not** support a specific causal ordering.  
- **RCA rankings:** Digest explicitly notes **low RCA confidence (0.47 / 0.25)** with **weak_directionality/ambiguous_roots**, so the specific “top root” series (e.g., `file_dirty`, `cpu.usage_usec`, `rbytes`) should be treated as **symptoms/early indicators**, not proven causes—this is why confidence is **medium**, not high.
