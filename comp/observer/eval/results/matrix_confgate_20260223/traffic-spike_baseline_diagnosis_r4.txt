============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

Be concise. Answer: 1. What do correlations mean? 2. Problem? 3. What? 4. Confidence 5. If uncertain, alternatives? 6. Evidence

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- There are **two distinct time-based clusters** of anomalies.  
- **TimeCluster 1 (236 sources, 1769636399→1769636485):** a broad, simultaneous shift across many **CPU, memory, PSI (pressure), I/O, and even “config-ish” fields (cpu.weight, io.weight, limits, populated/oom.group)** spanning **multiple containers** (frontend, backend, redis, cleanup). This looks like a **system-wide/state-change event** rather than a single-metric blip.  
- **TimeCluster 2 (10 sources at 1769636511):** a **backend-only CPU spike** (cpu_percentage + user/system/kernel/total usage) with one memory sub-metric (sock).

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Low** (for “there is an incident/problem” vs “expected environment change / instrumentation artifact”).

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Expected lifecycle/scale event (pods started/restarted/cleanup job ran):** Cluster 1 includes `cgroup.events.populated` across multiple containers and many metrics shifting together in a short window—consistent with **workload startup or reconfiguration**, not necessarily a fault.  
- **Metrics/feature bug (treating static settings as timeseries):** `cpu.weight`, `cpu.weight.nice`, `io.weight.default`, `cpu_limit_millicores`, `memory.max`, `oom.group` appearing as “shifted” suggests these might be **constant/step values** being anomaly-scored; that can create huge anomaly volume without a real issue.  
- **Node-level resource contention event:** PSI signals (`cpu.pressure.*`, `io.pressure.*`, `cgroup.pressure`) co-anomaly across containers could mean **host contention**, but we don’t see clear impact metrics (errors/latency) here, and CUSUM can fire on sustained baseline changes even if benign.  
- **Actual backend CPU burn:** Cluster 2 is tightly focused on backend CPU; could be real load, but we lack request/latency context and it’s a single timestamp.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- Massive anomaly volume with heavy dedup: **213,627 total**, **211,055 dedup_skipped**, **79 unique sources**.  
- **Cluster 1 spans multiple containers** (`todo-frontend`, `todo-backend`, `todo-redis`, `cleanup`) and many subsystems at the same time window **1769636399–1769636485**.  
- Presence of **pressure metrics** in Cluster 1: `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.pressure`.  
- Presence of **lifecycle/state-ish metrics** in Cluster 1: `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.populated`, `cgroup.v2.memory.oom.group`.  
- Sample anomalies show step-ups consistent with a phase change:  
  - cleanup I/O + CPU: `io.stat.rbytes` 4028→81920, `rios` 0.25→5, `cpu.usage_usec` 1353→27513 (all at 1769636453)  
  - frontend memory jumped: `smaps_rollup.rss` 9.9M→44.6M, `pss` 7.0M→32.0M, `private_dirty` 2.9M→17.9M (1769636457–6458)  
- **Cluster 2 backend-only CPU** at **1769636511**: `cpu_percentage`, `user/system/kernel/total_*` all together + `memory.stat.sock`.

7) **RCA/digest present? Do key sources/onset chain support conclusion?**  
- **No RCA/digest is present** in the provided JSON, so there is **no onset chain** to confirm or refute; conclusions are based only on the TimeCluster groupings and sample anomalies.
