============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   A single large incident window (~24s) where **hundreds of metrics across many families** anomalied together: kubelet runtime operation metrics (especially `runtime.operations.duration.count`), **node disk capacity/utilization** metrics (`system.disk.free/used/in_use/utilized` across many devices), plus widespread **container CPU, memory, page-fault, I/O-stall, network, and uptime** anomalies.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low** (digest RCA confidence 0.53 and “ambiguous_roots”).

5. **Alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Real node-level resource event (disk pressure / I/O contention / ephemeral storage churn)** causing kubelet/container runtime slowdowns and broad secondary effects; plausible because disk + kubelet runtime families dominate, but the data doesn’t show a clear causal ordering.  
   - **Container runtime / kubelet hiccup or restart / control-plane jitter** producing synchronized anomalies in many derived metrics (including uptime shifts), but the cluster is so broad it could also be a monitoring/collection artifact.  
   - **Monitoring artifact / baseline reset / scrape disruption**: CUSUM “shift” detections across many unrelated series in the same seconds can happen when collection changes or a systemic measurement discontinuity occurs.  
   Uncertainty is high because the correlator is **TimeCluster (no learned causality)** and the digest explicitly flags **ambiguous roots** with **no onset chain**.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **One correlation only**: `time_cluster_1` with **897 anomalous series**; `first_seen=1771417694`, `last_updated=1771417718`.  
   - **Breadth of affected families** (digest):  
     - `kubernetes.kubelet.runtime.operations.duration.count:avg` **87 series** (largest family)  
     - `system.disk.free/in_use/used/utilized:avg` **29 series each** (many devices)  
     - Many container runtime/CPU/mem families: `container.cpu.*` (17–18), `containerd.cpu.*` (17–18), `container.memory.*` (multiple), `container.memory.page_faults` **21**, `container.uptime` **21**, `cri.uptime` **21**  
     - System I/O latency/queue metrics present (`system.io.*`), plus load and network stacks.  
   - Sample anomalies show **CUSUM sustained shifts** in multiple containers: CPU usage/user/system up, memory usage/kernel up, page faults up, partial stalls up.

7. **Do RCA/digest key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**  
   - **Key sources (digest)**: emphasize **kubelet runtime operation counts** and **system disk capacity/utilization** series. This **supports** the hypothesis that the cluster is centered on **node storage/kubelet-runtime behavior**, but it does not prove causation.  
   - **Onset chain**: **null** in the digest, and the RCA confidence is **low/ambiguous**. Therefore the **ranked RCA series are not strong support** for a specific root cause; they only indicate some early-onset candidates, not a reliable causal chain.
