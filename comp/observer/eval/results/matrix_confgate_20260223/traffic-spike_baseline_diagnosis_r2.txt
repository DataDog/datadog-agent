============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- There are **two distinct time-correlated anomaly bursts**.  
- **TimeCluster 1 (236 anomalies, 1769636399–1769636485)**: a broad, near-simultaneous shift across **many metrics and multiple containers** (todo-frontend, todo-backend, todo-redis, cleanup) covering **CPU usage/pressure/throttling, memory current/peak/stat, I/O pressure/stat, pids, and even config-like weights**. This looks like a **system-wide/container-lifecycle or instrumentation/normalization change** rather than a single-component fault.  
- **TimeCluster 2 (10 anomalies at 1769636511)**: a **focused CPU spike/shift only on todo-backend** (CPU % and millicores, user/system/kernel), suggesting a **brief backend-specific load event** after the broader burst.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A (unclear).

4) **Confidence level**  
**Low** (leaning toward “likely non-application incident / baseline-reset or lifecycle-driven shifts”).

5) **Alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Baseline/training artifact or metric semantics change**: CUSUM learns from first 25% and then flags sustained “shifts”; a deployment/startup phase, scrape interval change, unit change, or exporter update could make *many* metrics jump together without a real incident. The cluster includes **weights/limits-like fields** (e.g., `cpu.weight`, `io.weight.default`) shifting, which often indicates config/reporting change rather than resource contention.  
- **Coordinated rollout/restart across pods**: `cgroup.events.populated` and many memory/cgroup stats shifting across multiple containers in the same window fits pods being created/populated and settling.  
- **Real node-level resource contention** (CPU+IO pressure increasing across pods): presence of **pressure metrics** anomalies could indicate contention, but without seeing actual magnitudes/durations and with config-like fields also “anomalous,” it’s hard to treat as confirmed performance degradation.  
- **Backend had a real short CPU event** (Cluster 2): could be legitimate, but it’s isolated and small compared to the broad Cluster 1.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Mass simultaneous multi-container cluster:** `TimeCluster: 236 anomalies` spanning **4 containers** (`todo-frontend`, `todo-backend`, `todo-redis`, `cleanup`) with `first_seen: 1769636399` and `last_updated: 1769636485`.  
- **Cross-domain anomalies at once:** includes `cgroup.v2.cpu.*` (usage, nr_periods, throttled), `cgroup.v2.*.pressure*` (cpu/io/cgroup pressure), `cgroup.v2.memory.*` (current/max/peak, anon/file/slab breakdown), `cgroup.v2.io.stat.*` (rbytes/wbytes/rios/wios), and `pids.*`.  
- **Example sustained shifts flagged by CUSUM:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rbytes` for `cleanup` shifted **~4.4σ** (4028 → 81920).  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec` for `cleanup` shifted **~4.4σ** (1353 → 27513).  
  - `smaps_rollup.rss/pss/private_dirty` for `todo-frontend` shifted materially upward (e.g., rss ~9.9M → ~44.6M).  
- **Config-like metrics also “shifted”:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice`, `cgroup.v2.io.weight.default` appearing in the same cluster across containers.  
- **Separate backend-only burst later:** `TimeCluster: 10 anomalies` at `1769636511` only for `todo-backend`, all CPU-related plus `memory.stat.sock`.

7) **RCA/digest present? Do key sources/onset chain support the conclusion?**  
- **No RCA section is present** in the JSON, so there is **no explicit onset chain** to confirm or refute. The **correlation patterns themselves** (broad multi-container + inclusion of weights/limits-like fields) are what primarily support the “unclear/possibly lifecycle or baseline shift” interpretation.
