============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- There’s one dominant incident window (**time_cluster_1**) where **almost every container metric (67 sources)** in `leaky-app` shifts together over ~77 seconds, indicating a broad, sustained state change rather than isolated noise.  
- A second, later micro-cluster (**time_cluster_2**) shows **CPU-only anomalies at a single timestamp**, likely a follow-on/aftershock or a separate short CPU burst.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
- **Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- `leaky-app` experienced a **sustained workload shift** consistent with a **memory-growth/leak-like behavior accompanied by increased I/O and CPU pressure**.

4) **Confidence level**  
- **Medium.**

5) **If not high confidence: alternatives + why uncertain**  
- **Intentional load/behavior change (not a leak):** Many “config/limit” metrics (e.g., `memory.max`, `cpu.weight`, `io.weight`) also “shift,” which can happen if the container was recreated or reconfigured, not necessarily due to pathological resource growth.  
- **Container lifecycle / measurement artifact:** The baseline is learned from the first 25% of data; if the container started “idle” and then began normal work, CUSUM will flag a sustained “shift” even if it’s expected.  
- **Unit/collection anomalies for procs/threads:** `cgroup.procs` and `cgroup.threads` jumping to **32327** is suspiciously high for a single container and could reflect parsing/aggregation issues or a mis-mapped metric.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Sustained I/O read increase:** `io.stat.rbytes` shifted to **1,662,976** (4.4σ above **81,785**), `io.stat.rios` to **20** (4.4σ above **0.98**) at `1769636331`.  
- **Memory footprint increase (process memory):** `smaps_rollup.pss` to **13,344,768** (baseline **3,082,082**), `pss_dirty` to **8,421,376** (baseline **1,876,632**) at `1769636336`.  
- **Anonymous memory growth signals:** `memory.stat.anon` / `active_anon` both shifted to **8,421,376** (baseline **1,876,632**) at `1769636336`.  
- **Kernel/slab growth:** `memory.stat.slab` to **218,888** (baseline **44,641**), `kernel` to **317,440** (baseline **64,808**), `pagetables` to **71,680** (baseline **13,899**) at `1769636335`.  
- **CPU involvement:** correlations include CPU usage and CPU pressure metrics in the big cluster; plus a later **CPU-only** cluster at `1769636372`.  
- **Correlated, container-scoped:** all anomalies share the same tags (`container_id:fc108741ec27`, `container_name:leaky-app`, `pod_name:memory-leak-ef48ae3f`).

7) **RCA/digest presence + whether it supports conclusion**  
- **No RCA/digest is present** in the JSON, so there’s **no explicit onset chain** to confirm causality; conclusions rely on the time clusters and the shifted metrics shown.
