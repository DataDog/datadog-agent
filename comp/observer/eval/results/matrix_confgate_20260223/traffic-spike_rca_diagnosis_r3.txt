This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- **time_cluster_1:** A large, near-simultaneous anomaly burst across **many metric families** (CPU pressure/throttling, IO pressure/stat, memory current/peak and many `memory.stat` fields, pids, smaps) affecting **multiple containers/pods** in the same namespace—i.e., a **system-wide contention/event** rather than a single-metric blip.  
- **time_cluster_2:** A smaller, single-timestamp cluster isolated to **todo-backend** combining **CPU usage** anomalies with **socket memory (`memory.stat.sock`)**.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
A brief incident of **node/host-level resource contention (CPU/IO/memory pressure) impacting multiple containers**, followed by a smaller **backend-specific CPU + socket-memory spike**.

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
**Medium** (the incident pattern is clear; precise root cause is not).

5) **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (if not high confidence)**  
- **Metrics/collection artifact or cgroup reconfiguration:** Many anomalies include **`cpu.weight*` and `io.weight.default` shifting**, which often change only if control knobs or defaults changed; could be instrumentation or configuration event rather than workload behavior.  
- **Workload phase change (batch/cleanup activity) causing shared-disk contention:** `cleanup` shows early **IO reads + CPU usage** shifts; could have induced disk pressure for others, but **directionality is flagged weak** and timing-only clustering can’t prove causation.  
- **Container churn / lifecycle event:** Presence of `cgroup.events.populated` and broad multi-metric shifts could coincide with containers starting/stopping, creating correlated baseline shifts without a “fault.”  
Uncertainty is primarily because **RCA confidence is low and onset_chain is null**, so we can’t reliably order causes vs effects.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Mass correlated cluster:** `time_cluster_1` has **236 anomalous series** across **~79 sources overall**, spanning CPU, IO, memory, pids, and smaps families (digest shows very broad `metric_family_counts`).  
- **Pressure signals present:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*` and `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*` families are included (digest lists `cpu.pressure.full.total`, `cpu.pressure.some.total`, `io.pressure.full.total`, `io.pressure.some.total`).  
- **Memory stress indicators:** `cgroup.v2.memory.current`, `memory.peak`, many `memory.stat.*` and `smaps_rollup.*` families are anomalous in the same cluster.  
- **Example “shift” anomalies near the cluster time:**  
  - `cleanup` container: `cgroup.v2.io.stat.rbytes` and `rios` shifted high; `cgroup.v2.cpu.stat.usage_usec` shifted high (all around timestamp ~1769636453).  
  - Other pods show large smaps/memory shifts around ~1769636457–6458.  
- **Secondary localized event:** `time_cluster_2` has **10 series** all from **todo-backend**, including `cpu_percentage`, `kernel/system/user cpu`, and `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.sock` at the same timestamp (1769636511).

7) **Do RCA/digest key sources and onset chain support the conclusion?**  
- **Digest supports** the conclusion of a **broad, system-wide contention/event** (huge family breadth in `time_cluster_1`, pressure + memory + IO all together; RCA confidence explicitly low).  
- **Onset chain does not support** a specific causal narrative because it is **null** for both clusters.  
- **RCA ranked “roots” are not reliable here** (both clusters flagged `weak_directionality`/`ambiguous_roots`, low confidence 0.49 and 0.25), but they are *consistent* with the hypothesis that early **CPU+IO activity (cleanup)** could coincide with the broader contention.
