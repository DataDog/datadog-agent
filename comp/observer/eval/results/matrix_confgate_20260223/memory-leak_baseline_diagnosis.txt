PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

Be concise. Answer: 1. What do correlations mean? 2. Problem? 3. What? 4. Confidence 5. If uncertain, alternatives? 6. Evidence

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   - There is one dominant incident window (**time_cluster_1**) where **67 different metrics** across **memory, CPU (incl. PSI), I/O, and pids/threads** all shifted together for the same container, lasting ~**77s** (1769636279→1769636356).  
   - A second, later, **single-timestamp CPU-only** blip (**time_cluster_2**, 7 metrics at 1769636372) suggests a brief follow-on CPU event after the main cluster.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   - **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   - The container **leaky-app** experienced a **sustained step-up in memory usage consistent with a memory leak/rapid allocation growth, accompanied by elevated CPU and increased I/O activity/pressure**.

4. **Confidence level**  
   - **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Workload phase change / legitimate traffic burst**: A new request pattern could simultaneously raise memory (anon), CPU, and I/O; CUSUM flags sustained shifts but doesn’t know intent.  
   - **Container (re)start / instrumentation artifact**: Abrupt shifts in limits/weights (e.g., `memory.max`, `cpu.weight`, `io.weight.default`) could reflect config changes rather than resource stress alone.  
   - **GC / caching behavior rather than leak**: Memory increases could be due to cache growth or delayed GC; without longer duration/monotonic trend or OOM signals, “leak” is suggestive but not proven.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Memory footprint jumped**: `smaps_rollup.pss:avg` to **13,344,768** (from **3,082,082**), `pss_dirty` to **8,421,376** (from **1,876,632**), `active_anon/anon` also **8,421,376**.  
   - **Kernel memory structures increased**: `memory.stat.slab` **218,888** (from **44,641**), `slab_reclaimable` **160,640** (from **32,762**), `pagetables` **71,680** (from **13,899**), `kernel_stack` **16,384** (from **3,341**).  
   - **I/O increased sharply**: `io.stat.rbytes` **1,662,976** (from **81,785**), `io.stat.rios` **20** (from **0.98**).  
   - **CPU stress signals co-occur**: cluster includes many `cpu.pressure.*` and `cpu.stat.*` plus `cpu_percentage`/usage metrics; later CPU-only cluster at **1769636372**.  
   - **Large correlated cluster**: `time_cluster_1` groups **67 sources** for the same container/pod over a sustained window (CUSUM “shift,” not a spike).

7. **RCA/digest present? do key sources/onset chain support conclusion?**  
   - **No RCA/digest field is present**, so there’s **no explicit onset chain** to confirm causality; the **time clusters and the included key sources (smaps PSS/anon, memory.stat*, cpu pressure, io.stat*)** are consistent with the conclusion but don’t prove root cause.
