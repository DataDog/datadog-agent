PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is **one big time-based cluster** (“time_cluster_1”) where **~2545 anomalies** across **many containers/metrics** occurred **nearly simultaneously (within 1s)** over a window **1771417694–1771418040**; the cluster is dominated by **CPU PSI partial stall**, **CPU usage/system**, and **CPU throttling** signals across both workloads and system daemons.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Node-wide transient CPU contention/scheduler pressure event** (or brief saturation) causing many containers’ CPU/PSI metrics to shift together; uncertain because the sample anomalies shown are largely **“below baseline”** shifts (drops), not clear “badness,” and we don’t see absolute thresholds/SLIs.  
   - **Instrumentation/collection artifact or step-change in scraping/aggregation** (e.g., metric pipeline change, restart, timestamp alignment) producing synchronized CUSUM detections across many series; uncertain because **449k total anomalies** with **439k dedup skipped** and only **1 correlation** suggests a broad systematic shift rather than a localized incident.  
   - **Workload mix / deployment change** leading to cluster-wide CPU pattern changes (many services at once); uncertain because we don’t have deployment/restart markers, and “uptime shifted” appears across multiple pods but could also be normal drift or sampling effects.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster:** `"total_correlations": 1` with `"title": "TimeCluster: 2545 anomalies"`  
   - **Time window of co-occurrence:** `"first_seen": 1771417694`, `"last_updated": 1771418040`  
   - **Cluster contents dominated by CPU pressure/throttling across many containers:** repeated sources like `demo|container.cpu.partial_stall:avg`, `demo|container.cpu.usage:avg`, `demo|container.cpu.system:avg`, plus `container.cpu.throttled` / `container.cpu.throttled.periods` (e.g., postgres, kindnet-cni).  
   - **Anomalies are often “shifted below baseline” (drops) across CPU/mem/IO):** e.g. `containerd.mem.current.usage` 2.1σ below, `cri.cpu.usage` below baseline, blkio serviced/bytes below baseline.  
   - **Scale suggests systemic effect:** `"total_anomalies": 449143`, `"unique_sources_in_anomalies": 318`, `"dedup_skipped": 439004`.

7. **RCA/digest present? Do key sources/onset chain support conclusion?**  
   **No RCA/digest is present** (no `rca` field), so there is **no onset chain/root ranking** to confirm; only the TimeCluster co-timing supports the “systemic/cluster-wide event or artifact” interpretation.
