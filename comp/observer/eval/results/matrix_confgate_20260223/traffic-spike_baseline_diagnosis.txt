PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

Be concise. Answer: 1. What do correlations mean? 2. Problem? 3. What? 4. Confidence 5. If uncertain, alternatives? 6. Evidence

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- **TimeCluster 1 (236 sources, 1769636399–1769636485):** A large, simultaneous shift across many **CPU, memory, IO, PSI/pressure, pids, and even “config/limit” type metrics** for multiple containers (todo-frontend, todo-backend, todo-redis, cleanup) in the same namespace—suggesting a **global/container lifecycle or monitoring/reset event** more than a single app issue.  
- **TimeCluster 2 (10 sources, single timestamp 1769636511):** A short, container-specific co-anomaly for **todo-backend** focused on CPU (and sock memory stat), consistent with a **brief workload burst** or a **measurement artifact**.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Low** (leaning toward “instrumentation/baseline/reset or container lifecycle event” rather than a true incident).

5) **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (since not high confidence)**  
- **Monitoring artifact / baseline break / counter reset / dedup behavior:** CUSUM learned baseline from first 25%; if containers started after that or metrics reset/changed semantics, many metrics would “shift” together without a real problem. The cluster includes metrics that normally don’t “behave” like workloads (e.g., **cpu_limit_millicores, memory.max, cpu.weight, io.weight**), which hints at configuration/reporting changes rather than resource stress.  
- **Real node-level contention event:** PSI (“pressure”) anomalies across multiple containers could reflect actual CPU/IO contention. Uncertain because the correlator is purely temporal and we don’t see external node metrics or a clear single root metric leading the chain.  
- **Legitimate workload phase change (scenario start/cleanup):** Presence of a **cleanup** container and broad shifts could be a test phase transition. Uncertain because the data doesn’t show the workload timeline, only anomaly timestamps.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- Massive simultaneous cluster: **“TimeCluster: 236 anomalies”** spanning **multiple pods/containers** (todo-frontend, todo-backend, todo-redis, cleanup) and many metric families.  
- Includes “static/config-like” metrics anomalizing:  
  - **cpu_limit_millicores:avg**, **cgroup.v2.memory.max:avg**, **cgroup.v2.cpu.weight:avg**, **cgroup.v2.io.weight.default:avg** (these shouldn’t usually drift like workload signals).  
- Pressure/PSI and throttling signals appear, but without a clear primary driver:  
  - **cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.* and io.pressure.* and cgroup.pressure** included in cluster 1.  
- Example workload-like shifts exist but are mixed across different containers:  
  - cleanup IO/CPU at **1769636453**: **io.stat.rbytes**, **io.stat.rios**, **cpu.stat.usage_usec** with ~4.4σ shifts.  
  - todo-frontend smaps at **1769636457–6458**: **private_dirty/rss/pss** increases.  
- Scale indicates noisy/redundant triggering: **total_anomalies 213,627**, **dedup_skipped 211,055**.

7) **RCA/digest presence and whether it supports conclusion**  
- **No RCA/digest section is present** in the JSON, so there is **no ranked root candidate or onset chain** to confirm/refute the conclusion.
