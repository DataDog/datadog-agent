============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- rca (optional): ranked root candidates + evidence paths + confidence flags
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   One dominant incident: a single TimeCluster where **~66 different metrics** for the same workload (*namespace:default, pod: crash-loop-2ad3b6ae, container_name: crasher*) became anomalous **at the same time**, spanning CPU pressure/throttling, memory growth, PIDs/threads, and I/O—i.e., a coordinated resource event rather than isolated noise.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The `crasher` container/pod is entering a runaway/crash-loop state causing a sustained shift: **exploding threads/PIDs plus increased memory and CPU pressure (with throttling) and elevated I/O activity.**

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternatives + why uncertain**  
   - **Container restarts / churn artifact:** `cgroup.events.populated` shifting toward 1 and the pod name including `crash-loop` could mean frequent restarts cause many metrics to “shift” together; without explicit restart count/exit codes it’s not definitive.  
   - **Intentional stress test / load spike:** a test workload could intentionally drive CPU/memory/I/O and many threads; CUSUM will flag the sustained level change even if “expected.”  
   - **Measurement/baseline mismatch:** CUSUM learns baseline from first 25%—if that baseline period was unusually idle, later normal activity could look anomalous.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlated cluster:** “TimeCluster: 66 anomalies” all for the same container/pod identity; `first_seen` 1769630443, `last_updated` 1769630485.  
   - **Threads/PIDs surge:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.threads:avg` shifted to **13085** from **2475**; `cgroup.v2.pids.max:avg` shifted to **2135** from **404**; cluster also includes `pids.current`, `pids.peak`, `container.pid_count`.  
   - **Memory jump:** `cgroup.v2.memory.current:avg` **7,991,296** from **1,511,867**; `smaps_rollup.rss:avg` **12,423,168** from **2,350,329**; `memory.stat.anon` and `smaps_rollup.pss_anon` both **7,262,208** from **1,373,931**; plus slab/percpu increases.  
   - **CPU contention/throttling:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.total:avg` **159,266** from **30,131**; `cpu.stat.local.throttled_usec:avg` **319,029** from **60,356**; cluster includes multiple `cpu.pressure.*` and `nr_throttled`.  
   - **I/O involvement:** `io.pressure.full.total:avg` **40** from **7.57**; `io.stat.rios` increased (**6** from **0.30**) and `io.stat.rbytes` increased (**86,016** from **4,230**).

7. **RCA/digest present? Do key sources/onset chain support the conclusion?**  
   **No RCA/digest section is present**, so there’s no explicit ranked onset chain to confirm; the TimeCluster co-onset across CPU/memory/PIDs/I/O **is consistent with** the conclusion but doesn’t prove the initiating cause.
