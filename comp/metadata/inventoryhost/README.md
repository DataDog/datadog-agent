# Inventory Host Payload

This package populates some of the Agent-related fields in the `inventories` product in DataDog. More specifically the
`host_agent` table.

This is enabled by default but can be turned off using `inventories_enabled` config.

The payload is sent every 10min (see `inventories_max_interval` in the config) or whenever it's updated with at most 1
update every 5 minutes (see `inventories_min_interval`).

# Content

The `Set` method from the component allows the rest of the codebase to add any information to the payload.

# Format

The payload is a JSON dict with the following fields

- `hostname` - **string**: the hostname of the agent as shown on the status page.
- `timestamp` - **int**: the timestamp when the payload was created.
- `host_metadata` - **dict of string to JSON type**:
  - `cpu_cores` - **int**: the number of core for the host.
  - `cpu_logical_processors` - **int**:  the number of logical cores for the host.
  - `cpu_vendor` - **string**: the CPU vendor.
  - `cpu_model` - **string**:  the CPU model.
  - `cpu_model_id` - **string**: the CPU model ID.
  - `cpu_family` - **string**: the CPU family.
  - `cpu_stepping` - **string**: the CPU stepping.
  - `cpu_frequency` - **number/float**: the CPU frequency.
  - `cpu_cache_size` - **int**: the CPU cache size in bytes (only fill on Linux, 0 for Windows and OSX).
  - `cpu_architecture` - **string**: the hardware name, Linux only (ex "x86_64", "unknown", ...).
  - `kernel_name` - **string**: the kernel name (ex: "windows", "Linux", ...).
  - `kernel_release` - **string**:  the kernel release (ex: "10.0.20348", "4.15.0-1080-gcp", ...).
  - `kernel_version` - **string**:  the kernel version (Unix only, empty string on Windows).
  - `os` - **string**: the OS name description (ex: "GNU/Linux", "Windows Server 2022 Datacenter", ...).
  - `os_version` - **string**: the OS version (ex: "debian bookworm/sid", ...).
  - `memory_total_kb` - **int**: the total memory size for the host in KiB.
  - `memory_swap_total_kb` - **int**: the `swap` memory size in KiB (Unix only).
  - `ip_address` - **string**: the IP address for the host.
  - `ipv6_address` - **string**: the IPV6 address for the host.
  - `mac_address` - **string**: the MAC address for the host.
  - `agent_version` - **string**: the version of the Agent that sent this payload.
  - `cloud_provider` - **string**: the name of the cloud provider detected by the Agent.
  - `cloud_provider_source` - **string**: the data source used to know that the Agent is running on `cloud_provider`.
    This is different for each cloud provider. For now ony AWS is supported.
    Values on AWS:
    - `IMDSv2`: The Agent successfully contacted IMDSv2 metadata endpoint.
    - `IMDSv1`: The Agent successfully contacted IMDSv1 metadata endpoint.
    - `DMI`: The Agent successfully used DMI information to fetch the instance ID (only works on Unix EC2 Nitro instances).
    - `UUID`: The hypervisor or product UUID has the EC2 prefix. The Agent knows it's running on EC2 but doesn't know
      which instance (see `hypervisor_guest_uuid` or `dmi_product_uuid`).
  - `cloud_provider_account_id` - **string**: The account/subscription ID from the cloud provider.
  - `cloud_provider_host_id` - **string**: the unique ID the cloud provider uses to reference this instance.
    This is different for each cloud provider (for now, ony AWS is supported).
    - On AWS: the instance ID returned by querying the IMDSv2 endpoint. An empty string is returned if we can't reach
      IMDSv2 (even if IMDSv1 is available).
  - `hypervisor_guest_uuid` - **string**: the hypervisor guest UUID (Unix only, empty string on Windows or if we can't
    read the data). On `ec2` instances, this might start with "ec2". This was introduced in `7.41.0`/`6.41.0`.
  - `dmi_product_uuid` - **string**: the DMI product UUID (Unix only, empty string on Windows or if we can't read the
    data). On `ec2` instances, this might start with "ec2". This was introduced in `7.41.0`/`6.41.0`.
  - `dmi_board_asset_tag` - **string**: the DMI board tag (Unix only, empty string on Windows or if we can't read the
    data). On `ec2` Nitro instances, this contains the EC2 instance ID. This was introduced in `7.41.0`/`6.41.0`.
  - `dmi_board_vendor` - **string**: the DMI board vendor (Unix only, empty string on Windows or if we can't read the
    data). On `ec2` Nitro instances, this might equal "Amazon EC2". This was introduced in `7.41.0`/`6.41.0`.
