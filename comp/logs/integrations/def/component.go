// Package integrations adds a go interface for integrations to send logs.
//
// The integrations component is a basic interface for integrations to send logs
// from one place to another. It has two faces: integrations can use the
// SendLog() function to send logs, and consumers can use the Subscribe()
// function to receive a channel that receives all the logs integrations send.
package integrations

// team: agent-metrics-logs

// Component is the component type.
type Component interface {
	// Subscribe subscribes returns a channel for a subscriber to receive logs from integrations.
	Subscribe() chan IntegrationLog

	// SendLog allows integrations to send logs to any subscribers.
	SendLog(log, integrationID string)
}
