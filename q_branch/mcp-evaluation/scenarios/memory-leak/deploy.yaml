# Cache Service Scenario
#
# Deploys a session cache service for managing user sessions.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Container starts with low memory usage (~30-40Mi for Python)
# - Cache grows as sessions are added
# - After ~1 minute, may hit resource limits
# - Exit code 137 may occur
# - Kubernetes restarts container
# - Cycle repeats
#
# Observable in fine-grained-monitor:
# - Rapid memory growth over ~1 minute
# - Pod restarts after reaching limits
# - Memory timeseries shows growth pattern
# - Useful for demonstrating changepoint detection and time-range correlation
