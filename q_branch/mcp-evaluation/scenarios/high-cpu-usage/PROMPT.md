# Investigation Request

I'm noticing one of our production servers is running slower than usual. Can you investigate the remote system to determine what might be causing performance issues?

## Context
- You have access to diagnostic tools to investigate the remote server
- Use the available tools to gather system information from the remote machine
- Document your investigation process and findings
- Propose mitigation steps based on what you discover
