# Investigation Request

We can't create new files on one of our production servers even though there's disk space available. Can you investigate the remote system to determine what's wrong?

## Context
- You have access to diagnostic tools to investigate the remote server
- Use the available tools to gather system information from the remote machine
- Document your investigation process and findings
- Propose mitigation steps based on what you discover
