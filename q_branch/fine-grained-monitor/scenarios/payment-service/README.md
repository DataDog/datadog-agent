# payment-service

Generated from gensim blueprint via Vibecoder.

## Services

- **load-generator** (buildable) - ports: 8089

- **payment-service** (buildable) - ports: 8081

- **fraud-db** - ports: 6379



## Usage

```bash
# Deploy scenario
./scenario.py run payment-service

# Check status
./scenario.py status

# View logs
./scenario.py logs

# Stop scenario
./scenario.py stop <run_id>
```

## Placeholders

The generated `deploy.yaml` contains placeholders that scenario.py substitutes at deploy time:

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `` | Unique run identifier (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`) |
| `` | Image tag for buildable components |
| `` | Kubernetes namespace for this run (`fgm-run-<run_id>`) |

Each run gets its own namespace for complete isolation between concurrent runs.

## Component Directories

Each buildable service has a directory with a Dockerfile:

```
payment-service/
├── deploy.yaml
├── README.md
├── load-generator/
│   └── Dockerfile
├── payment-service/
│   └── Dockerfile
```
