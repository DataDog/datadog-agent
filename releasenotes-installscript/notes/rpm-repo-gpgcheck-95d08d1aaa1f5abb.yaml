# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-INSTALLSCRIPT.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Activate `repo_gpgcheck` on RPM repositories by default. `repo_gpgcheck`
    is still set to `0` when using a custom `REPO_URL` or when running on
    RHEL/CentOS 8.1 because of a [bug in dnf](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1792506).
    The default value can be overriden by specifying `DD_RPM_REPO_GPGCHECK`
    variable. The allowed values are `0` (to disable) and `1` (to enable).
