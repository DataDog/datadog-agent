# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-INSTALLSCRIPT.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.
