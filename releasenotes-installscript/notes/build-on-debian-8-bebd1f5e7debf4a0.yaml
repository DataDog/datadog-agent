# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-INSTALLSCRIPT.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Since datadog-agent 6.36/7.36, Debian 7 (Wheezy) is no longer supported,
    ``install_script.sh`` now installs 6.34/7.34 when the minor version is unpinned
    and ``DD_AGENT_FLAVOR`` doesn't specify a version. This will be changed to
    6.35/7.35 when these versions are released.
