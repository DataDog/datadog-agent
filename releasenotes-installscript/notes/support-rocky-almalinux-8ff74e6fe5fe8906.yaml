# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-INSTALLSCRIPT.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The ``install_script.sh`` now supports AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux installation.
    Note that only datadog-agent, datadog-iot-agent and datadog-dogstatsd since
    version 6.33/7.33 support these distributions, so trying to install older
    versions will fail.
