# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    On Debian-based systems, the install script now installs the
    datadog-signing-keys package in addition to the datadog-agent package.
    
    For users using the official apt.datadoghq.com repository: the datadog-signing-keys
    package is already present in the repository, no further action is necessary.

    For users with custom mirrors or repositories: the datadog-signing-keys
    package must be present in the same repository channel as the datadog-agent
    package, otherwise the install script will fail to install the Agent.
