# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-INSTALLSCRIPT.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Improvements for APT keys management

    - By default, get keys from keys.datadoghq.com, not Ubuntu keyserver
    - Always add the ``DATADOG_APT_KEY_CURRENT.public`` key (contains key used to sign current repodata)
    - Add ``signed-by`` option to all sources list lines
    - On Debian >= 9 and Ubuntu >= 16, only add keys to ``/usr/share/keyrings/datadog-archive-keyring.gpg``
    - On older systems, also add the same keyring to ``/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d``
