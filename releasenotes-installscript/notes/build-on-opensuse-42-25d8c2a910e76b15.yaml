# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-INSTALLSCRIPT.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Since datadog-agent 6.33/7.33, the SUSE RPMs are only supported on OpenSUSE >= 15
    (including OpenSUSE >= 42) and SLES >= 12. On OpenSUSE < 15 and SLES < 12,
    ``install_script.sh`` now installs 6.32/7.32 when minor version is unpinned
    and ``DD_AGENT_FLAVOR`` doesn't specify version.
