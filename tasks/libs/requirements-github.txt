# Python requirements to run the github invoke tasks
# Cannot be put in the main requirements file because:
# - cryptography doesn't build on arm, it needs additional libraries (at least libffi) that are not in
#   the arm builder (and that are not needed, given we don't use cryptography in arm jobs).
# - but adding the '; platform_machine == "x86_64"' to work around that breaks on python3.5, which some
#   jobs still use
