class DynTestExecutor:
    """Executes dynamic test selection using a lazily-loaded stored index.

    The executor uses lazy loading to find and load indexes on-demand:
    1. Initialize with backend, commit SHA, and index kind (no index loaded yet)
    2. Index is automatically loaded when first accessed via index() method
    3. Uses the index to determine impacted tests for specific changes

    This class bridges the gap between stored indexes and actual test execution,
    handling the complexity of finding appropriate historical indexes when the
    exact commit doesn't have one available.

    Typical workflow:
    1. Initialize with backend, index kind, and commit SHA
    2. Call tests_to_run() or tests_to_run_per_job() with changed packages
    3. Index is automatically loaded on first use
    4. Execute the returned tests in your CI system

    Lazy Loading Benefits:
    - Allows evaluator to handle index loading errors gracefully
    - Defers expensive index loading until actually needed
    - Enables better error reporting and monitoring
