============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Almost all anomaly events are *mass-synchronous*: hundreds of different metrics (CPU, memory, IO, pids, hugetlb, cgroup metadata) are flagged at the same seconds, forming a few big time clusters. That pattern looks like a *systemic step-change or measurement artifact* rather than one resource-specific incident.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternatives and why uncertain**  
   - **Instrumentation/scrape/reset artifact (most likely):** simultaneous anomalies across nearly every metric type and container commonly happen when the collector restarts, counters reset, label sets change, or a parsing/unit bug appears; the gigantic “scores” also suggest extreme deviations consistent with resets/invalid values.  
   - **Node-level disruption (possible):** a brief node freeze/resume, cgroup reconfiguration, or runtime event could create synchronized discontinuities across cgroup files, but the data shown doesn’t include explicit node events/logs to confirm.  
   - **Real multi-resource incident (less likely):** a true CPU+memory+IO contention spike could correlate, but seeing *cgroup topology/limit-style metrics* (e.g., max.depth, cpu.weight.nice, hugetlb max) anomalize together is more characteristic of state/reporting changes than workload behavior.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **One cluster contains essentially everything:** `time_cluster_8` has **267 sources** (matching `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 267`) spanning cgroup metadata, CPU, memory, IO, smaps.  
   - **Multiple large clusters a second apart:** several clusters with **184–207 sources** (`time_cluster_2`..`time_cluster_7`) occurring in a tight time range (`first_seen` ~1768514009 to 1768514042).  
   - **Cross-subsystem breadth:** clustered sources include **CPU pressure/stat**, **memory events/stat/pressure**, **IO pressure/stat**, **pids**, **hugetlb**, plus **cgroup max depth/descendants**—too broad for a single-resource bottleneck.  
   - **Extreme outlier scores:** many sample anomalies show scores like **10,000,000,000** and even **1,351,680,000,000,000** (`smaps_rollup.pss:avg`), consistent with discontinuities/resets/bad reads.  
   - **Anomalies include “configuration-ish” metrics:** e.g., `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:count`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count`, `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.*.max:count` flagged alongside usage/pressure metrics.
