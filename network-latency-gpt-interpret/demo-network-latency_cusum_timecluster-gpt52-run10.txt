============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All 257 metric sources that ever anomalied were grouped into a single “simultaneous” time cluster, meaning the correlator is essentially telling you “everything shifted around the same times,” not separating distinct incident sub-events or causal relationships.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Baseline/training artifact:** CUSUM learns from the first 25% of the data; if that period is not representative (startup/idle), later “normal operation” looks like a sustained shift, producing massive anomalies across many metrics.  
   - **System-wide step change (real but not necessarily bad):** a deployment, load increase, node pressure, or cgroup limit change could shift CPU/memory/pressure metrics together without being an incident.  
   - **Collection/telemetry behavior:** metric shape changes (counters vs gauges, resets, new containers/IDs) can cause widespread “shifts.”  
   Uncertainty is high because the correlator produced only one giant cluster (no specificity), and several sample anomalies have low σ (0.7–1.3σ), suggesting sensitivity/baseline issues rather than a clear fault.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Extremely broad co-occurrence:** `total_correlations: 1` with **`source_count: 257`** (“Correlated: 257 anomalies in time window”).  
   - **Huge anomaly volume:** `total_anomalies: 270861` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257` (suggests sustained/structural shift, not a small incident signature).  
   - **Many anomalies are weak shifts:** examples show **0.7–1.3σ** shifts (e.g., `cpu_percentage` 0.7σ, `total_cpu_usage_millicores` 0.7σ, `smaps_rollup.pss` 0.8σ).  
   - **Some stronger shifts exist but across different containers/times:** e.g., `kernel_cpu_percentage` **7.3σ** (todo-backend at `1768514104`) and `system_cpu_percentage` **3.8σ** (todo-redis at `1768514629`), indicating multiple step changes rather than one clean incident.  
   - **Cluster spans a long window:** `first_seen: 1768514043`, `last_updated: 1768514634` (~10 minutes), consistent with “sustained shift” detection and/or baseline mismatch.
