============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All detected anomalies are being lumped into a single large co-occurring cluster (184 metrics) centered on **cgroup freeze/frozen events** and **memory OOM events**, meaning many resource/pressure/memory stats changed together within ~10s rather than being isolated to one subsystem.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The containers experienced a **memory-pressure episode leading to OOM activity**, with knock-on effects across memory stats, swapping/zswap, and CPU/IO pressure, potentially accompanied by cgroup freezing during the incident.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Collection/processing artifact or step-change/reset:** The LightESD scores are all saturated at `1e10`, and *everything* correlates into one mega-cluster, which can happen if counters reset, the exporter restarts, timestamps jump, or the baseline window changes—making real vs. synthetic anomalies hard to separate.  
   - **Planned lifecycle event (pod restart/scale/cleanup job):** abrupt changes in `cgroup.procs`, descendant counts, and widespread smaps counters can occur when containers restart/terminate, not necessarily from pathological pressure.  
   - **Kernel memory-management behavior without true OOM kills:** spikes in workingset refaults, THP, dirty/writeback, and PSI can come from heavy IO or cache churn; without explicit confirmation of `oom_kill` increments in the sample, the “OOM occurred” part is inferred from the correlated sources list.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Single correlation cluster: `total_correlations: 1` with `source_count: 184` and title **“cgroup...frozen ↔ ...memory.events.oom”**.  
   - Cluster includes explicit OOM-related metrics:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom:count`, `...oom_kill:count`, `...oom_group_kill:count` (and local variants).  
   - Cluster includes strong pressure signals across subsystems:  
     - CPU PSI: `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10/60/300`, `...some.*`  
     - IO PSI: `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.avg10/60/300`, `...some.*`  
     - Memory PSI: `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.*`, `...some.*`  
   - Sample anomalies show memory thrash / reclaim patterns:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.workingset_refault_anon:count` (todo-backend)  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count` and `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.file_thp:count`  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.file_dirty:count`, `...file_writeback:count`  
     - Swap/zswap activity: `cgroup.v2.memory.swap.events.max:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswpin:count`  
   - Process/cgroup structural changes coincident with the event:  
     - `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs:count`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.stat.nr_descendants:count`, `cgroup.v2.pids.max:count` in anomalies.  
   - Timing indicates a short burst window: `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768514033` (~48s).
