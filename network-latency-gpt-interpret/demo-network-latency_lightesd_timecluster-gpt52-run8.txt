PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all metrics across CPU, memory, I/O, pids, hugetlb, and even cgroup metadata anomalied at the same timestamps, forming a few large “everything moved together” time clusters—consistent with a node-wide event (or monitoring/collection artifact) rather than a single container-specific issue.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics pipeline/collection glitch (most likely):** simultaneous anomalies across hundreds of unrelated metrics often happens when scraping pauses, timestamps jump, counters reset, units change, or a parser breaks (LightESD then flags many series at once). Uncertain because raw values and direction (drop vs spike) aren’t shown.  
   - **Node-level disruption / container runtime event:** kubelet/containerd restart, cgroup hierarchy rebuild, or mass container churn can cause many cgroup “count”/limit/pressure fields to change together. Uncertain because there’s no explicit host-level events/logs here.  
   - **Real resource incident (CPU/memory/IO pressure):** could be genuine contention causing PSI + usage anomalies together. Uncertain because PSI anomalies shown are mostly `:count` and we don’t see sustained elevated averages except in smaller clusters.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Huge synchronized clusters:** `time_cluster_8` has **267 sources** anomalous together; other clusters have **184–207 sources** within seconds.  
   - **Cross-subsystem breadth:** correlated sources include **CPU usage/pressure**, **memory current/events/pressure/stats**, **I/O pressure/stats**, **pids**, **hugetlb**, and **cgroup metadata** (`cgroup.max.depth`, `cgroup.procs`, `events.populated`, etc.).  
   - **Timing suggests a bursty global event:** clusters occur in a tight window (`first_seen` ~1768514009 to ~1768514078).  
   - **Extremely large anomaly scores on “count”/config-like metrics:** e.g., `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count` score `1e10`, `smaps_rollup.shared_hugetlb:count` score `2e10–3e10`, which often indicates “value became weird/zero/changed format” rather than organic workload behavior.  
   - **Total volume is enormous:** `total_anomalies: 170565` with only `total_correlations: 9`, implying many repeated anomalies driven by a small number of synchronized events.
