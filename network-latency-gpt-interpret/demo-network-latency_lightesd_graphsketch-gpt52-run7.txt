PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   GraphSketch found essentially **one big co-occurrence cluster** where *nearly every collected metric* anomalies at the same time, so the “correlation” is dominated by a **global, synchronized event** rather than a specific causal chain between a few metrics.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low** (that there is a real system/container issue vs. an instrumentation/collection artifact).

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics pipeline / scrape artifact (very likely):** The detector is flagging huge numbers of metrics across multiple containers at the same timestamps, which often happens when counters reset, exporters restart, scrapes fail/return zeros, or label/cardinality changes—this produces “anomalies everywhere,” and the correlator then learns a giant cluster.  
   - **Host-level disruption affecting all cgroups (possible):** A brief node freeze, runtime hiccup, or system-wide resource event could cause many PSI/memory/cgroup counters to jump together across containers.  
   - **Short-lived workload lifecycle event (possible):** Many containers restarting/being recreated around the same time can cause synchronized changes in `cgroup.procs`, descendant counts, and various memory stats.  
   **Why uncertain:** the output lacks the *actual metric values/directions* and doesn’t show a small set of leading indicators; it mainly shows “everything anomalied together,” which is ambiguous.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Massive, global cluster:** `total_anomalies: 8716`, `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 184`, `total_correlations: 1`, and the single correlation has `source_count: 184` (i.e., almost all sources).  
   - **Cluster title points to broad cgroup events:** “**cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom**” but it’s bundled with CPU/IO pressure, memory, pids, smaps, etc., suggesting a synchronized event rather than a tight root cause.  
   - **Same anomaly timestamps across multiple containers/metrics:** sample anomalies concentrate at `1768513985` and `1768514035` for different containers (backend/frontend/redis/cleanup).  
   - **Extremely high/outlier scores everywhere:** many samples show `score: 10000000000.00`, consistent with a systemic discontinuity (reset/gap) rather than a single metric drifting.  
   - **Edges dominated by smaps_rollup co-anomalies with very high counts/frequency:** e.g., `observations ~4933` across many smaps pairs, indicating “these all spike together” (common when the underlying process set changes or scrape/export behavior changes).
