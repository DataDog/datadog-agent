============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Almost all metrics (267 unique sources) are “anomalous” at the same timestamps in large time clusters, which is characteristic of a shared event affecting metric collection/representation (or a global state change) rather than one subsystem failing in isolation.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities & why uncertain**  
   - **Telemetry/collection artifact (most likely):** simultaneous anomalies across nearly every cgroup/smaps/CPU/memory/IO metric suggests a scrape outage, exporter restart, counter reset, unit/scale change, or missing-data-to-zero/null substitution that LightESD flags as extreme outliers.  
   - **Container/pod churn or cgroup tree change:** many “count” metrics (limits/max fields, events, depths) anomaly together, consistent with mass container lifecycle changes causing abrupt structural/statistical shifts.  
   - **Real node-level stall/pressure event:** CPU/IO/memory pressure metrics are included, so a short host contention episode could co-occur—but the breadth (including many configuration-like “max/weight” fields) makes this less convincing.  
   Uncertain because the output provides anomaly *scores and co-timestamps* but not the *actual values/directions* (e.g., spike vs drop-to-zero), nor any collector health signals.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Huge simultaneous clusters:** `time_cluster_8` = **267 sources** (covers CPU, memory, IO, smaps, pids, cgroup metadata) from **1768514043–1768514078**.  
   - **Repeated back-to-back mass clusters:** `time_cluster_2..6` each have **184 sources** at consecutive seconds **1768514033–1768514042**.  
   - **Extremely large outlier scores** for many “count/config” metrics (typical of discontinuities/resets), e.g.  
     - `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count (score: 1e10)`  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:count (score: 1e10)`  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.file_mapped:count (score: 1e10)`  
   - **Implausibly extreme memory anomaly score**: `smaps_rollup.pss:avg (score: 1.35168e15)` (suggests a value jump/drop or unit/parse issue).  
   - **Cross-container involvement** in samples (different container_ids/pods: `cleanup`, `todo-frontend`, `todo-backend`, `todo-redis`) indicating it’s not isolated to one workload.
