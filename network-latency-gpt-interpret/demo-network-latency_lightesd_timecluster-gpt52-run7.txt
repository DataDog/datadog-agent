PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- There are multiple bursts where *very large numbers of metrics* across CPU, memory, I/O, pids, and even cgroup metadata all became “anomalous” at the same second(s), with the biggest cluster spanning **267 sources** over ~35 seconds. This pattern looks more like a *global/collection artifact or systemic event* than a single-metric or single-resource incident.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
- **Unclear**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- N/A

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
- **Low**

5) **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (since not high confidence)**  
- **Metrics pipeline / scrape artifact (most likely):** simultaneous anomalies across hundreds of unrelated metrics often happen when values reset to 0, become missing/NaN, spike due to unit/parse change, or a collector restarts—LightESD will flag the step-change everywhere. Uncertain because raw before/after values aren’t shown.  
- **Node-level stall or cgroup-wide pause:** a brief host contention/freeze (CPU pressure, I/O pressure, memory pressure shifting together) could produce widespread correlated changes. Uncertain because we don’t see the direction/magnitude (e.g., pressure increasing) or host-level corroboration.  
- **Workload restart / container churn event:** many “count” metrics (events, limits, maxima) shifting together can occur during pod/container recreation. Uncertain because correlations are by *metric name only* (not broken out by container) and the sample shows anomalies across different containers.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Mass simultaneous clustering:** `time_cluster_8` = **267** anomalous sources, `first_seen` **1768514043** to `last_updated` **1768514078**.  
- **Repeated large clusters in adjacent seconds:** clusters `time_cluster_2`..`time_cluster_6` each show **184 anomalies** at consecutive seconds (**1768514033–1768514042**).  
- **Cross-domain involvement:** correlated sources include CPU pressure (`cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`), I/O pressure (`cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`), memory pressure/events (`cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.*`, `cgroup.v2.memory.events.*`), pids, and smaps (`smaps_rollup.*`) all at once.  
- **“Count”/config-like metrics anomalous with extreme scores:** examples like `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:count`, `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.*.max:count` with scores shown as **1e10**, consistent with step-changes/resets rather than organic load.  
- **Anomalies span multiple containers/pods:** sample anomalies include `cleanup` (BestEffort), `todo-frontend`, `todo-backend`, `todo-redis`, suggesting the event isn’t isolated to one container.
