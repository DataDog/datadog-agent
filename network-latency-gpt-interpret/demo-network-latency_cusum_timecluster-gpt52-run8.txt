PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All 257 metric sources anomalied in the same 1-second windows, so the correlator formed a single giant “everything changed together” cluster; it indicates simultaneity but not a causal relationship, and is consistent with a broad state change or an instrumentation/baseline shift.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Baseline/training artifact:** CUSUM “learns normal” from the first 25%; if the workload changed after that (deploy, warmup, traffic ramp), CUSUM will flag sustained “shifts” across many metrics without an actual incident.  
   - **Metric collection change / restart / tag or identity churn:** a scrape/agent restart or container recreation can cause step-changes or new series that look like shifts across many cgroup/smaps counters simultaneously.  
   - **Real workload shift (traffic spike or batch job):** could genuinely raise CPU and memory (including slab) across multiple containers, but the sample shows mixed magnitudes and some low-σ shifts, which makes severity hard to judge from this summary alone.  
   Uncertain because TimeCluster groups purely by timestamp and the output doesn’t show whether user-facing symptoms (OOMs, throttling, errors, latency) occurred—only that many metrics deviated from an early baseline.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster containing all sources:** `total_correlations: 1`, cluster has `source_count: 257` titled “Correlated: 257 anomalies in time window”.  
   - **Huge anomaly volume and breadth:** `total_anomalies: 270861`, `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257`.  
   - **Sustained “shift” style anomalies across CPU + memory + pids:** e.g.  
     - `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg shifted: 0.16 → 1.46 (7.3σ)` (todo-backend)  
     - `system_cpu_percentage:avg shifted: 0.03 → 0.34 (3.8σ)` (todo-redis)  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.slab:avg shifted: 40150 → 237517` and `slab_unreclaimable` increase (todo-redis)  
     - `cgroup.v2.pids.current:avg shifted: 1.01 → 6.00 (2.2σ)` (todo-redis)  
   - **Time span suggests a long-running regime change rather than a brief incident:** cluster `first_seen: 1768514043`, `last_updated: 1768514634` (~10 minutes).
