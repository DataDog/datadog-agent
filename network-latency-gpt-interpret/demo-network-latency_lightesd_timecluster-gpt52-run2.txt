============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   They show large, time-synchronized bursts where *hundreds of different metrics* across CPU, memory, IO, PIDs, hugetlb, and even cgroup metadata all became “anomalous” at the same moments—suggesting a shared external trigger (collection/agent/cgroup hierarchy event) rather than many independent resource issues.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **Alternative possibilities & why uncertain (since not high confidence)**  
   - **Metrics pipeline/collection artifact** (scrape restart, counter reset, missing-to-zero/backfill, unit/scale change): would make many unrelated metrics trip the outlier detector at the *exact same timestamps*. Uncertain because raw values/baselines aren’t shown—only anomaly “scores.”  
   - **Short node-level disturbance affecting everything** (brief CPU stall, cgroupfs read hiccups, IO pause): could simultaneously perturb many metrics; uncertain because we don’t see actual PSI values or durations, only that they co-occurred.  
   - **Container/pod churn or cgroup subtree changes** (cleanup job, pod restarts): could impact cgroup.* “events/populated/procs/depth” plus derived usage metrics; uncertain because we don’t see Kubernetes events or lifecycle timestamps.  
   - **Real multi-resource contention incident**: possible, but less likely given the breadth (267 sources) and inclusion of “static-ish” config/limit-like metrics (e.g., max/depth/weight) anomalizing together.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Massive simultaneous clustering:** `time_cluster_8` has **267 sources** with `first_seen: 1768514043` and `last_updated: 1768514078`.  
   - **Repeated wide bursts:** multiple clusters with **184–207 sources** (`time_cluster_2`..`time_cluster_7`) occurring in adjacent seconds (1768514009–1768514042).  
   - **Cross-domain metrics in the same clusters:** CPU pressure (`cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`), IO pressure (`cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`), memory pressure/events (`cgroup.v2.memory.*`), pids, hugetlb, and even cgroup structural metrics (`cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth`, `nr_descendants`, `populated`).  
   - **Extreme outlier scores on “count/config-ish” metrics:** e.g., `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count (score: 1e10)`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:count (score: 1e10)`, `smaps_rollup.shared_hugetlb:count (score: 2e10–3e10)`—pattern consistent with resets/collection quirks.  
   - **Very large score on a core usage metric:** `smaps_rollup.pss:avg (score: 1.35168e15)` and `system_cpu_usage_millicores:avg (score: 6.45e9)`—could be real spikes, but also consistent with scaling/unit or baseline discontinuity when many metrics shift together.
