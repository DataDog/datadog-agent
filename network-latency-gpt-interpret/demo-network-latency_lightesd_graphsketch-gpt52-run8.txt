PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   GraphSketch found one big cluster where **almost every metric (184 sources) anomalied together within ~10s**, centered on **cgroup freeze/frozen events and memory OOM events**—i.e., a single system/container lifecycle event is driving widespread “simultaneous” anomalies rather than many independent issues.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   A burst of **container-level memory pressure culminating in OOM events and/or cgroup freeze activity** affecting multiple containers at the same time.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Low.**

5. **Alternative possibilities / why uncertain**  
   - **Instrumentation/collection artifact or restart:** Many metrics can “jump” together if the exporter restarts, counters reset, or cgroups are recreated; LightESD flags those as extreme outliers, and GraphSketch then correlates everything.  
   - **Planned orchestration event:** Node drain, pod eviction, or a cleanup job could cause **freeze/thaw + process count changes** without a true resource incident.  
   - **Short window with mass state transition:** The anomalies are clustered into a very tight time range; without actual metric values/trends, it’s hard to distinguish **real OOMs** from **counter/state transitions**.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster**: `total_correlations: 1` with `source_count: 184` (nearly all anomalous sources tied together).  
   - **Cluster title indicates key pair**: “**cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom**”.  
   - **Tight timing**: `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768514033` (~48s window).  
   - **Widespread resource-pressure signals included in cluster**: CPU/IO/memory pressure metrics (e.g., `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.*`, `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.*`, `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.full.*`).  
   - **Sample anomalies show abrupt changes across multiple containers** around the same timestamps (1768513985/1768514035):  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.swap.events.max`, `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.avg60` (todo-frontend)  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.workingset_refault_anon`, `smaps_rollup.pss_file`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs` (todo-backend)  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10`, `kernel_cpu_percentage` (cleanup)  
   - **Extremely high LightESD scores** (`1e10`) for many metrics suggests “step/reset/state change” type outliers, consistent with either a real incident or a telemetry lifecycle event.
