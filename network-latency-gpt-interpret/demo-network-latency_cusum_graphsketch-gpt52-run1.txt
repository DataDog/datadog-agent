============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All anomalies collapsed into a single large co-occurring cluster (171 metrics) within ~10 seconds, meaning the container experienced one tightly-coupled event that simultaneously impacted CPU pressure, memory pressure/limits, OOM events, PID peak, and many memory accounting fields (smaps/cgroup memory.stat), rather than multiple independent issues.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
Yes.

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
The `cleanup` container was memory-constrained and hit cgroup memory pressure leading to OOM kills (group kill), accompanied by system-wide resource contention signals (CPU/IO pressure) during the same incident window.

4) **Confidence level**  
Medium.

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
- **Container restart/teardown artifact:** Many “:count shifted 1→2” anomalies across diverse metrics can happen when a cgroup is recreated or counters increment once during lifecycle transitions; the cluster includes cgroup freeze/frozen/populated signals which can be lifecycle-related.  
- **General node pressure rather than container-local root cause:** CPU/IO pressure metrics can rise due to host contention affecting the container; without node-level context it’s unclear whether the container caused pressure or was a victim.  
- **Metric semantics/encoding issue:** The detector is flagging numerous counters with tiny absolute changes (often +1), suggesting the anomaly engine may be treating monotonic event counters as level-shift signals, inflating “unique sources” and making the correlation less diagnostic.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- OOM indicators:  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom_group_kill:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (appears multiple times)  
- Memory pressure/limit signals correlated in same cluster:  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.high:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - cluster includes `cgroup.v2.memory.current`, `memory.high`, `memory.max`, `memory.pressure.*`  
- CPU pressure correlated in same cluster:  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg60:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- Process/PID involvement:  
  - `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- Correlator output indicates one incident window:  
  - Single correlation: `graphsketch_cluster_0` with **171 sources**, `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768513987`  
- Memory accounting shifts consistent with heavy memory activity around the event:  
  - anomalies/edges dominated by `smaps_rollup.*` (rss/pss/dirty/swap/etc. co-moving frequently)
