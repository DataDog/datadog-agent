============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all metric anomalies across CPU, memory, I/O, pids, and even “config/static” cgroup files occurred **simultaneously in a few tight time windows**, indicating a **systemic/collection-layer event** (or global container lifecycle event) rather than independent per-metric behavior.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A (unclear).

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Low.**

5. **Alternative possibilities / why uncertain (since not high confidence)**  
   - **Metrics collection/reset artifact** (scrape restart, counter reset, missing samples filled with 0, timestamp jump): would create mass simultaneous outliers across unrelated signals, including “static” cgroup settings.  
   - **Node/container runtime event** (node reboot, kubelet/cAdvisor restart, cgroup hierarchy recreation): would also produce broad simultaneous shifts in many cgroup and smaps values.  
   - **Real resource incident (CPU/memory/I/O contention)**: possible because PSI and CPU usage metrics are included, but the presence of many *configuration-like* metrics anomalizing together makes a pure workload incident less certain.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Mass co-occurrence:** `time_cluster_8` has **267 sources** anomalous together (essentially all unique sources), and similar large clusters exist (`207`, multiple `184`).  
   - **Very tight timing:** clusters span seconds: e.g. `time_cluster_2` **1768514033–1768514034**, `time_cluster_3` **1768514035–1768514036**, … `time_cluster_6` **1768514041–1768514042**.  
   - **Cross-domain metrics in same clusters:** CPU pressure (`cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`), memory pressure/events/stats (`cgroup.v2.memory.*`), I/O pressure/stats (`cgroup.v2.io.*`), pids, plus smaps rollup and container CPU metrics all in the same time clusters.  
   - **“Static/config-like” metrics anomalizing:** e.g. `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:count`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count`, `cpu_limit_millicores:count` included in the big simultaneous clusters—this pattern often points to a collection or lifecycle/reset event.  
   - **Anomaly volume is extreme:** `total_anomalies: 170565` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 267`, consistent with a broad systemic change rather than a single container issue.
