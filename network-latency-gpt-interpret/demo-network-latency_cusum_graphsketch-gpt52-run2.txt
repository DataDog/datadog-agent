PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All anomalous metrics (171 distinct sources across CPU, memory, IO, pids, smaps) are behaving as a single tightly time-coupled event/episode (one GraphSketch cluster), meaning the anomalies co-occur rather than being isolated independent issues.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container is hitting severe **memory pressure leading to OOM (including OOM group kills)**, with concurrent CPU pressure/pid changes consistent with the workload thrashing and then being killed.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics artifact / counter-step effect:** Many anomalies are “shifted 1 → 2” on `:count` sources, which could reflect small counter increments being treated as large deviations rather than large resource changes.  
   - **Short-lived container lifecycle event (start/stop/freeze) rather than sustained leak:** The cluster title references `cgroup...frozen` and many cgroup configuration/stat fields; rapid lifecycle transitions can make many metrics change together.  
   - **System-wide/node contention:** CPU pressure anomalies could be driven by host contention impacting this BestEffort pod, not necessarily the app itself.  
   Uncertainty is mainly because the sample shows counter increments and lacks direct magnitude context (e.g., actual `memory.current` values, limits, duration).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - Direct OOM signals:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom_group_kill:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (repeated)  
     - Correlation cluster includes `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom:*` and `...oom_kill` / `...oom_group_kill` sources.
   - Memory pressure accompanying OOM:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.high:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10/avg300:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - Cluster includes extensive `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.{some,full}.*` metrics.
   - CPU pressure co-occurs:  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10/avg60:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - Cluster includes `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.{some,full}.*` and throttling-related CPU stats.
   - Process/pids impact:  
     - `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - Cluster includes `cgroup.v2.pids.current/max/events.max`.
   - Correlator indicates “everything moved together”:  
     - `total_correlations: 1` with `source_count: 171` (single episode).  
     - Cluster title: `Correlated: cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom:count (freq: 10560.0, 171 sources)`.
