PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all detected anomalies across many cgroup/SMAPS/CPU/IO metrics are happening in the same short time window and are strongly co-occurring (one giant cluster), which is consistent with a single container lifecycle event (stop/freeze/kill/restart) causing many counters/gauges to change together rather than many independent issues.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: what are the alternative possibilities and why are you uncertain?**  
   - **Benign container restart/termination (most likely):** many correlated anomalies are in cgroup “events”/“procs”/pressure and SMAPS fields that can jump or reset when a container is recreated.  
   - **OOM kill / memory limit breach:** the correlation title explicitly includes `memory.events.oom`, but the sample doesn’t show actual event increments/values, only “anomaly” flags.  
   - **Node-level or storage-level contention spike:** IO/CPU pressure metrics are anomalous, which could be real contention, but the cluster is too broad (184 sources) and could simply reflect a systemic reset/collection artifact.  
   - **Metrics/collector artifact:** extremely large identical scores (`1e10`) across many sources suggests the detector is flagging discontinuities/resets rather than distinct abnormal magnitudes.  
   Uncertainty is high because we don’t see actual metric values/trends (only anomaly events), and the correlator formed a single “everything moved together” cluster, which is common for lifecycle/resets.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single massive correlation cluster:** `total_correlations: 1`, `source_count: 184` (almost every metric co-anomalied together).  
   - **Correlation title points at lifecycle/kill signals:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom` in the cluster title.  
   - **Tight time window:** `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768514033` (~48s).  
   - **Process/cgroup structure changed:** sample anomaly in `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs:count` and `cgroup.v2.cgroup.stat.nr_descendants:count`.  
   - **Pressure + memory activity anomalies across containers:** sample anomalies include `cpu.pressure.full.avg10`, `io.pressure.full.avg60`, `memory.swap.events.max`, `workingset_refault_anon`, `file_dirty`, `file_writeback`.  
   - **Many repeated, extreme anomaly scores:** multiple sample anomalies show `score: 10000000000.00`, consistent with abrupt discontinuity/reset detection rather than nuanced deviation.
