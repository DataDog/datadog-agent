PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   GraphSketch found essentially **one big co-occurring anomaly “episode”**: many cgroup v2 + smaps + CPU/memory/IO metrics anomalied together within the same short window, with a headline association around **`cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom`**, meaning the system often sees **container freeze/stop activity at the same time as memory/OOM-type signals**.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics-collection / scrape artifact**: Many “anomalies” have an extreme identical score (`1e10`) across unrelated metrics and multiple containers at nearly the same timestamps, which can happen with **missing/zero/NaN/backfill or counter resets** rather than real resource events.  
   - **Container lifecycle event** (restart/stop/freeze): spikes in `cgroup.procs`, descendant counts, and “frozen/populated” signals can co-occur during **rapid pod churn**, producing broad correlated anomalies without a single resource root cause.  
   - **Real memory pressure / OOM episode**: correlation title references OOM and there are swap/pressure signals, but the provided sample doesn’t show explicit OOM-kill increments or memory.current/max relationships, so it’s not provable from this excerpt.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single huge correlation cluster**: `total_correlations: 1`, `source_count: 184`, titled **“frozen ↔ oom”** with very high freq (`107478.6`).  
   - **Tight time window**: `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768514033` (~48 seconds).  
   - **Many metrics across subsystems anomalous together**: CPU pressure (`cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.*`), IO pressure (`cgroup.v2.io.pressure.*`), memory events (`cgroup.v2.memory.events.*`), swap (`cgroup.v2.memory.swap.*`), plus many `smaps_rollup.*`.  
   - **Sample shows “pressure/swap/memory-stat” anomalies across multiple containers** (backend/frontend/redis/cleanup) at the same two timestamps (1768513985 and 1768514035).  
   - **Uniform extreme anomaly scoring**: sample anomalies repeatedly show `score: 10000000000.00`, consistent with a systemic discontinuity rather than nuanced outliers.  
   - **Edges dominated by smaps_rollup co-anomalies** with thousands of observations (`observations ~4k–5k`), suggesting a broad “everything about memory mapping changed at once” pattern, which can be caused by restart/scrape artifacts as well as real memory events.
