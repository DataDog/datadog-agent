============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is only one time-cluster, and it contains *all* 257 anomalous metric sources—i.e., the system flagged a broad, simultaneous “shift” across nearly every CPU/memory/I/O/cgroup metric at roughly the same time window, which is more consistent with a global baseline/collection change than a localized incident.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Monitoring/baseline artifact:** CUSUM learns “normal” from the first 25% and then flags sustained shifts; a configuration change, workload phase change, or metric scaling/units change could cause *everything* to “shift” and get clustered together.  
   - **Container lifecycle/rollout event:** simultaneous shifts across many containers/metrics can happen when pods restart, migrate nodes, or cgroup settings change (limits/weights), producing step changes in many counters/gauges at once.  
   - **Real node-wide resource event:** a genuine host-level contention event (CPU pressure, memory reclaim/pressure, I/O pressure) could move many metrics together, but the provided sample anomalies show mostly modest σ for many key signals and are spread across different containers, making it hard to attribute to one concrete failure.  
   Uncertainty is high because the correlator is purely temporal (no causal understanding) and the single mega-cluster suggests “everything changed,” which is ambiguous without knowing if an infrastructure/deploy change occurred.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation containing all sources:** `total_correlations: 1`, cluster title: **“Correlated: 257 anomalies in time window”**, `source_count: 257`.  
   - **Cluster spans almost every subsystem metric family:** CPU usage/percentages, cpu pressure, memory.current/stat/*, memory pressure, io pressure/stat, pids, cgroup events, smaps rollups.  
   - **Very large volume of anomaly events:** `total_anomalies: 270861` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257` (suggests sustained/ongoing shifts across many metrics).  
   - **Sample anomalies show multi-container, mixed small-to-moderate shifts rather than one clear smoking gun:** e.g., `smaps_rollup.pss` (0.8σ), `total_cpu_usage_millicores` (0.7σ), alongside a few larger CPU/kernel shifts (e.g., `kernel_cpu_percentage` 7.3σ) but not tied to a single container only.  
   - **Time window is broad but treated as one cluster:** `first_seen: 1768514043`, `last_updated: 1768514634` yet still one aggregated time cluster, consistent with a systemic step-change or detector sensitivity issue rather than discrete incidents.
