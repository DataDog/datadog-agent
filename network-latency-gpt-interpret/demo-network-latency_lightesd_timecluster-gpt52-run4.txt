PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all metrics across CPU, memory, I/O, pids, and even cgroup config-like fields anomalied at the same timestamps, forming a few large “all-at-once” time clusters—this looks like synchronized discontinuities (scrape/reset/collect issue or cgroup lifecycle events) rather than a single subsystem degradation.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain?**  
   - **Metrics collection artifact (most likely):** simultaneous anomalies across hundreds of unrelated metrics often indicate scrape gaps, exporter restart, counter resets, unit/scale change, or a parsing bug; TimeCluster groups by exact time so this amplifies “global” collector events.  
   - **Node-level pause/hiccup or container churn:** a brief node stall, kubelet/containerd restart, or mass cgroup creation/destruction can cause many cgroup files to change at once and create widespread “outliers.”  
   - **Real resource incident (less likely from this view):** a true CPU+memory+I/O contention event could correlate, but the presence of anomalies in static/config-ish fields (e.g., cpu.weight.nice, *.max.*) suggests instrumentation/lifecycle effects more than load.  
   Uncertainty because the output provides anomaly *scores/timestamps* and co-occurrence, but not the underlying metric values/directions (spike vs drop to zero), nor host-level context (scrape errors, restarts).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Very large synchronized clusters:** `time_cluster_8` has **267 sources** anomalous together (first_seen **1768514043**, last_updated **1768514078**).  
   - **Repeated multi-second bursts:** clusters `time_cluster_2` through `time_cluster_6` each show **184 sources** anomalous in adjacent seconds (**1768514033–1768514042**), consistent with a systemic discontinuity rather than isolated metric behavior.  
   - **Cross-domain coverage in the same clusters:** sources include CPU pressure/stats, memory current/events/stat, I/O pressure/stat, pids, and smaps rollups all together.  
   - **Anomalies include “config/static” fields:** e.g., `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.max:count`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count` appearing as extreme outliers, which often happens on resets/lifecycle changes rather than organic workload shifts.  
   - **Huge anomaly volume:** **170,565** total anomalies across **267** unique sources, suggesting a broad systematic trigger.
