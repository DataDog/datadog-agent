============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All 257 metric sources anomalied together in the same 1‑second windows, meaning the correlator is essentially reporting a “everything shifted at once” event rather than identifying a specific causal relationship; it’s a broad, simultaneous regime change affecting CPU, memory, IO, and even mostly-static cgroup fields.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A (unclear).

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **Alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Telemetry/collection artifact or restart**: Seeing anomalies across many “count/static-ish” cgroup files and across all subsystems at once is more consistent with an exporter restart, changed scrape target, or baseline reset than with a single workload issue.  
   - **Container/pod lifecycle event (mass start/stop/migration)**: A coordinated rollout or node/container restart can shift many metrics simultaneously (CPU, memory, pids, pressure).  
   - **Real workload incident**: Could be a genuine system-wide load increase, but the “everything at once” clustering plus huge anomaly volume makes it hard to isolate a single failing component from this output alone.  
   Uncertainty is driven by **TimeCluster** only grouping by simultaneity (no causality) and **CUSUM** flagging sustained shifts—so a global step-change in instrumentation or environment can look like a massive incident.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster covering all sources**: `total_correlations: 1`, cluster title: *“Correlated: 257 anomalies in time window”*, `source_count: 257`.  
   - **Very large anomaly volume**: `total_anomalies: 270861` with `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257` (nearly every metric source flagged).  
   - **Cluster spans many subsystems simultaneously**: CPU (`cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_*`, `system_cpu_*`), memory (`cgroup.v2.memory.*`, `smaps_rollup.*`), IO pressure/stats (`cgroup.v2.io.*`), pids (`cgroup.v2.pids.*`), and even cgroup metadata/events (`cgroup.v2.cgroup.*`).  
   - **Example “shift” anomalies across different containers near the same period**:  
     - `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg` for `todo-backend` shifted `0.16 → 1.46 (7.3σ)` at `1768514104`.  
     - `system_cpu_percentage:avg` for `todo-redis` shifted `0.03 → 0.34 (3.8σ)` at `1768514629`.  
     - Memory slab for `todo-redis`: `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.slab:avg` `40150 → 237517` at `1768514629`.  
   - **Correlation window is broad**: cluster `first_seen: 1768514043`, `last_updated: 1768514634`, consistent with a sustained regime shift rather than a brief localized spike.
