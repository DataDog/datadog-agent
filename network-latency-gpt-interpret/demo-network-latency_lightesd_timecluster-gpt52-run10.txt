============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all metrics (267 unique sources) are “anomalous” at the same moments, forming a few large time clusters; this looks like a global, synchronized shift affecting collection/values across CPU/memory/I/O/cgroup/smaps rather than a single resource-specific incident.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternatives & why uncertain**  
   - **Metrics pipeline/collection artifact (most likely):** simultaneous anomalies across hundreds of unrelated counters/averages often happens with scraper restarts, missing samples, resets, timestamp jumps, or unit/format changes; the data shows extreme scores on many “:count” signals that are typically stable/constant.  
   - **Host-level event impacting all containers (possible):** node stall, CPU starvation, or cgroup hierarchy changes could move many metrics together, but we don’t see actual raw values—only anomaly “scores” and source names—so we can’t verify real pressure/usage spikes versus telemetry distortion.  
   - **Workload lifecycle burst (possible):** mass container churn/cleanup could touch many cgroup fields at once, but the breadth (CPU, memory, IO, hugetlb, pids, smaps) and repeated clusters suggests instrumentation effects as much as workload behavior.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **One huge correlation:** `time_cluster_8` has **267 sources** correlated, spanning **CPU, memory, IO pressure, pids, hugetlb, smaps_rollup, and container CPU metrics** (`source_count: 267`, `first_seen: 1768514043`, `last_updated: 1768514078`).  
   - **Multiple adjacent huge clusters:** `time_cluster_2..6` each show **184 sources** correlated within seconds (`first_seen: 1768514033..1768514041`).  
   - **Extremely large anomaly counts overall:** `total_anomalies: 170565` with `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 267` indicates widespread flagging, not a narrow incident.  
   - **Many “configuration/limit-like” fields flagged with extreme scores:** e.g. `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count (score: 1e10)`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:count (score: 1e10)`, `cgroup.v2.memory.zswap.max:count (score: 1e10)`—these are often constant and shouldn’t “spike” frequently unless values/reset/ingestion changed.  
   - **Pressure/usage metrics also flagged simultaneously:** e.g. `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.avg10:count`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg60:count`, `system_cpu_usage_millicores:avg`, suggesting the “anomaly” is not confined to one subsystem.
