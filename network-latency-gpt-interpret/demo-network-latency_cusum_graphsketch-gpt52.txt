PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There’s essentially one big co-occurring anomaly cluster: when the container/pod hits **memory/OOM conditions**, a large set of **CPU pressure, memory pressure, paging, hugetlb, and pid/cgroup state metrics** shift together within a short window—i.e., a single event is driving widespread metric deviations rather than independent issues.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The `cleanup` container (BestEffort) is experiencing **memory exhaustion leading to OOM (including OOM group kills)** with concurrent resource pressure signals.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **High.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   N/A (high confidence).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- Explicit OOM indicators anomalied:  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom_group_kill:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (appears multiple times)  
- Memory pressure anomalies:  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg300:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- CPU pressure concurrently anomalous (consistent with system under contention/thrashing around OOM):  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg60:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- Paging / reclaim signals anomalous (common around memory exhaustion):  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pgmajfault:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.pglazyfree:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- Process count/peak also shifts:  
  - `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- Correlator groups **171 sources** into one cluster whose title includes `...memory.events.oom...`, indicating broad co-occurrence:  
  - `source_count: 171`, title references `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom:count` and `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen:count`  
- All sample anomalies share the same workload identity:  
  - `container_name:cleanup`, `qos_class:BestEffort`, same `container_id`, same `namespace/pod` tags.
