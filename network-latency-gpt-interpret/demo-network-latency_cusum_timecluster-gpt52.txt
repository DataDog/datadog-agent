============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All detected anomalies (257 distinct metrics) are being lumped into a single “simultaneous” time cluster, meaning many metrics across CPU/memory/pids/etc. deviated around the same timestamps; however, this also suggests the correlator is over-grouping (effectively “everything changed at once”) rather than isolating a small causal set.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Low.**

5. **Alternative possibilities and why uncertain (if not high confidence)**  
   - **Baseline/learning-window artifact:** CUSUM “normal” is learned from the first 25%—if the workload ramps up after warm-up, CUSUM will flag a sustained “shift” across many metrics even if it’s expected.  
   - **Metric collection/reset artifact:** many `:count`-type metrics and broad cgroup stats shifting together can happen if containers restarted, counters reset, cgroup paths changed, or the scraper changed; TimeCluster will group them all.  
   - **Real incident vs. normal phase change:** there are some CPU and memory increases, but the sample includes several low-sigma shifts (0.7–1.3σ) alongside a few high-sigma ones, which is consistent with a global regime change, not necessarily a fault.  
   - **Over-correlation by design:** TimeCluster groups anything within 1s; with high anomaly volume (270,861), collisions into one mega-cluster are likely even if there are multiple unrelated issues.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single huge cluster:** `total_correlations: 1` and correlation “Correlated: 257 anomalies in time window” with `source_count: 257` spanning CPU, memory, IO pressure, pids, smaps, etc.  
   - **Very high anomaly volume:** `total_anomalies: 270861` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257` (suggests broad shift, not a single metric going bad).  
   - **Mixed significance shifts:** examples include small deviations like `total_cpu_usage_millicores shifted ... (0.7σ)` and `smaps_rollup.pss shifted ... (0.8σ)` alongside larger ones like `kernel_cpu_percentage ... (7.3σ)` and `system_cpu_percentage ... (3.8σ)`.  
   - **Multi-container involvement:** anomalies shown for `todo-redis`, `todo-backend`, `todo-frontend`, and `cleanup`, consistent with a system/workload-wide change rather than one container-specific failure.  
   - **Timing indicates a sustained period:** cluster `first_seen: 1768514043`, `last_updated: 1768514634` (many minutes of “shifted” state rather than a single spike).
