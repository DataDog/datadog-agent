PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   Nearly all metrics across CPU, memory, I/O, pids, hugetlb, and cgroup state anomalied *at the same timestamps* in a few bursts (esp. one large burst), which strongly suggests a shared underlying event affecting metric collection/values (or a global container lifecycle event), not an isolated resource issue in one container.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low**

5. **If not high confidence: what are the alternative possibilities and why are you uncertain?**  
   - **Telemetry/collector artifact or schema/unit change**: so many disparate metrics spiking simultaneously (including limit/config-like metrics such as `*.max`, `cpu.weight*`, `cpuset.mems.effective`) is more consistent with instrumentation/collection anomalies than real resource contention.  
   - **Container/pod churn or cgroup recreation**: simultaneous “count” anomalies across many cgroup files can happen when cgroups appear/disappear, reset, or are briefly unreadable; the correlator groups by time only and doesn’t separate by container.  
   - **Real node-level incident (CPU/memory pressure)**: possible because PSI (`cpu.pressure.*`, `io.pressure.*`, `memory.pressure.*`) and CPU usage metrics are included, but without the *direction/magnitude* (actual values) and without host-level context, it’s hard to confirm.  
   Uncertainty is high because the output shows **co-occurrence and scores**, but not the actual metric values/trends, and the clustering is purely time-based (can lump unrelated containers together).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single huge synchronous cluster**: `time_cluster_8` has **267 sources** anomalous together, spanning CPU, memory, IO, pids, smaps, and cgroup metadata; window **1768514043–1768514078**.  
   - **Repeated near-identical bursts**: clusters `time_cluster_2` through `time_cluster_6` each show **184 anomalies** in consecutive seconds (**1768514033–1768514042**), suggesting a repeating/systematic event.  
   - **Very large total anomaly volume**: **170,565 anomalies** across **267 unique sources**, which is typical of a broad event or telemetry issue rather than one failing component.  
   - **Config/limit-ish metrics also anomalous**: e.g., `cgroup.v2.cpu.weight.nice:*`, `cgroup.v2.cpu.uclamp.*`, `cgroup.v2.memory.max:*`, `cgroup.v2.hugetlb.*.max:*`, `cpuset.mems.effective:count`—these usually don’t “spike” due to runtime load.  
   - **Multiple containers implicated in samples**: anomalies shown for `cleanup` (BestEffort), `todo-frontend`, `todo-backend`, `todo-redis`, implying the event is not confined to one container.
