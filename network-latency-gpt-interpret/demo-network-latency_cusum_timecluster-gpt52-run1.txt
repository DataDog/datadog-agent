============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   There is only one time cluster containing *all* 257 anomalous metric sources, meaning the detector marked a broad, simultaneous “shift” across essentially every cgroup/CPU/memory/IO metric at the same timespan—this looks like a global regime change or instrumentation/collection discontinuity rather than a few related metrics moving together.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: what are the alternative possibilities and why are you uncertain?**  
   - **Monitoring/metrics pipeline change or reset** (agent restart, counter reset, unit/scale change, label/cardinality change): would cause many metrics to “shift” together and produce a single giant cluster.  
   - **Workload-wide step change** (deployment/traffic surge affecting many containers at once): could also move many metrics together, but you’d typically expect stronger, more consistent resource symptoms (e.g., sustained CPU pressure, IO pressure, OOM/high events), which aren’t shown here.  
   - **CUSUM baseline artifact** (first 25% baseline not representative; later period differs structurally): can create mass anomalies across many metrics.  
   Uncertain because the correlator only groups by time (no causality), and the sample shows mixed containers and modest σ for many metrics while still generating an enormous anomaly count.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation containing everything:** `total_correlations: 1`, cluster has `source_count: 257` (i.e., all unique anomalous sources).  
   - **Massive anomaly volume:** `total_anomalies: 270861` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257` (suggests systematic shift, not a localized incident).  
   - **Anomalies span many unrelated subsystems simultaneously:** CPU (`system_cpu_percentage`, `kernel_cpu_percentage`, `total_cpu_usage_millicores`), memory (`smaps_rollup.*`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.*`), pids (`cgroup.v2.pids.current`), and many cgroup event/count metrics all in the same time cluster.  
   - **Sample anomalies are across different containers/pods:** `todo-redis`, `todo-backend`, `todo-frontend`, `cleanup` all showing shifts near the same timestamps.  
   - **Some shifts are small in σ yet still flagged broadly:** e.g., `smaps_rollup.pss ... (0.8σ)`, `total_cpu_usage_millicores ... (0.7σ)`, consistent with a baseline/regime mismatch rather than a sharp resource fault.
