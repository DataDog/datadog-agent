============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- The correlator produced **one single time cluster** containing **all 257 anomalous metric sources**, meaning the detector flagged a broad, near-simultaneous “shift” across almost every collected cgroup/smaps/CPU/memory/IO metric during the same general period, rather than a small set of related signals.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
- **Unclear**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- N/A

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
- **Low**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
- **Baseline/seasonality mismatch:** CUSUM learns “normal” from the first 25%—if workload changes after that (deployment, warmup, traffic step), it will flag sustained shifts across many metrics.  
- **Instrumentation/collection artifact:** A change in scraping/aggregation, container identity churn, or metric definition/units can make many metrics “shift” at once.  
- **Node/container lifecycle event:** A restart/migration/cgroup reconfiguration can cause many cgroup and smaps counters/levels to jump together.  
- Uncertain because the output shows **mass, cross-domain anomalies** (CPU + memory + pids + many cgroup event/counter fields) with **only simple temporal clustering** and no indication of user-impact signals (OOM kills, max events) being highlighted as dominant.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **One correlation only:** `total_correlations: 1` with **`source_count: 257`** (“Correlated: 257 anomalies in time window”).  
- **Huge anomaly volume:** `total_anomalies: 270861` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257` (nearly everything).  
- **Broad metric families included simultaneously:** CPU pressure/stat/usage, IO pressure/stat, extensive memory.stat fields, smaps_rollup fields, pids fields.  
- Sample shifts look like step changes but not consistently extreme:  
  - `system_cpu_percentage:avg shifted: 0.03 → 0.34 (3.8σ)` (todo-redis)  
  - `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg shifted: 0.16 → 1.46 (7.3σ)` (todo-backend)  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.slab:avg shifted: 40150 → 237517 (2.2σ)` (todo-redis)  
  - `cgroup.v2.pids.current:avg shifted: 1.01 → 6.00 (2.2σ)` (todo-redis)  
- The correlated window spans a period: `first_seen: 1768514043` to `last_updated: 1768514634`, consistent with a sustained “new regime” rather than a single isolated metric fault.
