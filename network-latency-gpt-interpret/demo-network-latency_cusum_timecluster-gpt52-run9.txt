============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All 257 metrics that ever anomalied were grouped into a single “simultaneous” time cluster, meaning the detector saw a broad, near-system-wide shift happening at about the same times rather than a small set of tightly related metrics moving together.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Unclear.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A.

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
**Low.**

5) **Alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
- **Monitoring / collection artifact or step-change in instrumentation**: One giant cluster containing essentially *everything* is typical of a global baseline/scale change (agent restart, sampling interval change, counter reset handling), not a single resource incident.  
- **Coordinated workload change (deployment/test start) across multiple containers**: Could be a real event if many pods changed behavior at once, but the cluster lacks specificity (no smaller sub-clusters).  
- **CUSUM “baseline learned on first 25%” mismatch / regime change**: If the first quarter wasn’t representative (warm-up, idle period), CUSUM will flag sustained “normal” operation later as anomalous across many series.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Only 1 correlation cluster** with **source_count = 257** (i.e., basically all anomalous sources lumped together).  
- **Very high anomaly volume**: `total_anomalies: 270861` with only `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257` → repeated triggering across many metrics.  
- Cluster spans a long interval: `first_seen: 1768514043`, `last_updated: 1768514634` (sustained regime).  
- Sample anomalies show **many different subsystems/containers** shifting (CPU, pids, smaps, slab), e.g.  
  - `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg shifted: 0.16 → 1.46 (7.3σ)` (todo-backend)  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.slab:avg shifted: 40150 → 237517` (todo-redis)  
  - `cgroup.v2.pids.current:avg shifted: 1.01 → 6.00` (todo-redis)  
  - `smaps_rollup.pss:avg shifted: 19.9M → 32.2M` (todo-frontend)  
- Many sample shifts are **small σ (0.7–1.3σ)** yet flagged, consistent with CUSUM accumulating “debt” after a baseline/regime change rather than sharp incident signatures.
