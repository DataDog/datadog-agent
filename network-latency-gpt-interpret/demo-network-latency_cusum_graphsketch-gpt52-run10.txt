============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All (171) anomalous metrics are effectively part of one co-occurring cluster, meaning the system saw a single “event window” where CPU pressure, memory pressure/VM stats, OOM-related counters, pids, and related smaps_rollup values all shifted together (rather than independent, unrelated issues).

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
The `cleanup` container (BestEffort) experienced severe memory pressure culminating in OOM and OOM group kills, with concurrent CPU pressure/throttling signals consistent with resource starvation during the same incident.

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
**Medium.**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Metrics-counter artifact / “first OOM event” step-change:** many anomalies are `:count` fields shifting `1 → 2` with “10σ”, which can happen when rare counters increment once and CUSUM treats that as a sustained shift; this inflates anomaly count and can make one incident look like broad systemic instability.  
- **Container lifecycle effects (restart/freeze/populate):** correlated cgroup “frozen/populated” metrics suggest state transitions could coincide with OOM handling/restarts, and state changes can cause many counters to move together.  
- **Host-level contention rather than only this container:** CPU pressure signals could be from node contention impacting the container, not necessarily the container being the sole cause; without node-wide context and actual values (only “count shifted”), attribution is uncertain.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **OOM evidence:** `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count` and `...oom_group_kill:count` both “shifted 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)” (multiple timestamps around `1768513989–1768513990`).  
- **Memory pressure evidence:** `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10:count` and `...avg300:count` also shifted `1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
- **CPU pressure evidence:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10/avg60:count` shifted `1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
- **Process pressure evidence:** `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count` shifted `1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
- **Single correlated incident:** only **1 correlation cluster** with **171 sources** (`graphsketch_cluster_0`, `first_seen` ~`1768513985`, `last_updated` ~`1768513987`).  
- **Container context:** anomalies tagged to `container_name:cleanup`, `qos_class:BestEffort` in `namespace:fgm-run-7cc5530c`.
