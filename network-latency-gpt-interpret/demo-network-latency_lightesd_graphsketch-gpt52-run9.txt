PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   GraphSketch found essentially **one big co-occurring anomaly cluster**: when anomalies happen, **almost all cgroup/CPU/memory/IO/smaps metrics spike together within ~10s**, with the cluster “anchored” on **`cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen` ↔ `cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom`**. This looks like a **single systemic event (or instrumentation artifact) affecting many metrics at once**, not a few independent issues.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Real resource incident (memory pressure / OOM / swapping / IO pressure) impacting multiple containers**: suggested by OOM-related and pressure-related sources being central, but we don’t see actual metric *values* or deltas—only anomaly flags/scores.  
   - **Container lifecycle/restart or cgroup recreation causing mass “outliers”**: many metrics listed are counters/limits/state-like fields; abrupt resets/creation can look anomalous across many sources simultaneously.  
   - **Metrics pipeline/scrape issue (zeroes, NaNs, unit change, cardinality shift)**: the extremely uniform huge scores and the “everything correlated” pattern can happen when ingestion changes rather than the system.  
   Uncertainty is high because the output lacks **directionality/values**, and the correlation cluster is **too broad** (184 sources), which is consistent with both “big incident” and “data artifact”.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation covering almost everything:** `total_correlations: 1`, `source_count: 184`, title references **`...frozen` ↔ `...oom`** with very high freq (**107478.6**).  
   - **Very high anomaly volume and breadth:** `total_anomalies: 8716`, `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 184`.  
   - **Time-concentrated event window:** correlation `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768514033` (~48 seconds).  
   - **Pressure and memory stress signals appear among anomalous sources:** sample anomalies include `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10`, `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.avg60`, `cgroup.v2.memory.swap.events.max`, `...workingset_refault_anon`, `...file_dirty`, `...file_writeback`.  
   - **Many anomalies show identical extreme scores:** multiple samples have `score: 10000000000.00`, consistent with either extreme outliers or a detector/pipeline saturation effect.  
   - **Edges dominated by smaps_rollup co-anomalies:** many high-frequency edges among `smaps_rollup.*` (e.g., `pss_file`, `private_dirty`, `anon_huge_pages`) indicating memory-map metrics also moved together, but not pinpointing a single root metric.
