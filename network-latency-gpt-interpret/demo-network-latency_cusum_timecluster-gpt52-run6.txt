============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- The correlator found exactly **one big time cluster** where **all 257 unique metrics** flagged anomalies **at essentially the same time**, repeatedly across a long window. This indicates the detector is treating a broad, simultaneous baseline shift (or measurement/collection change) as one “incident,” not a small set of causally-related metric anomalies.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
- **Unclear**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- N/A

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
- **Low**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
- **Collection/semantics change**: a restart/upgrade of the metrics agent, cgroup layout change, or unit/normalization change can shift *many* series at once, which CUSUM will flag as sustained “shifts.” Uncertain because we don’t see explicit “agent restart” signals, only the symptom (everything shifts together).  
- **Container/pod churn or label/cardinality changes**: anomalies include different container_ids for the same app (e.g., todo-redis), suggesting restarts/redeploys that can reset baselines and create step-changes across many derived metrics.  
- **Real node-level resource event**: a genuine system-wide change (CPU scheduling/throttling/pressure, memory behavior) could affect many metrics simultaneously, but the sample shows many shifts are small in σ (0.7–1.3σ), which looks more like broad drift than a sharp failure.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single correlation only**: `total_correlations: 1` with **`source_count: 257`** (“Correlated: 257 anomalies in time window”).  
- **Massive anomaly volume**: `total_anomalies: 270861` across `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 257` (nearly every metric source anomalied).  
- **Long-lasting cluster**: `first_seen: 1768514043` to `last_updated: 1768514634` (~10 minutes) suggesting sustained shifts rather than a brief spike.  
- **Step-shift descriptions across many domains** (CPU + memory + pids) occurring in the same general period, e.g.:  
  - CPU: `kernel_cpu_percentage:avg shifted: 0.16 → 1.46 (7.3σ)`; `system_cpu_percentage:avg shifted: 0.03 → 0.34 (3.8σ)`  
  - Memory/slab: `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.slab:avg shifted: 40150 → 237517` and `slab_unreclaimable` also up  
  - Process count: `cgroup.v2.pids.current:avg shifted: 1.01 → 6.00`  
- **Many shifts are low σ** (e.g., 0.7–1.3σ in several samples), consistent with a broad baseline drift/offset affecting many metrics rather than a single sharp malfunction.
