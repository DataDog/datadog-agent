PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All detected anomalies are essentially one co-occurring “storm”: CPU pressure, memory pressure/stat changes, OOM events, pid/hugetlb-related signals (and lots of smaps_rollup fields) all anomalied within the same short window, indicating a single incident affecting many subsystems in that container/cgroup.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container hit severe **memory pressure leading to OOM kills**, accompanied by system-wide contention signals (CPU/memory PSI) consistent with resource exhaustion in a BestEffort pod.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternatives + why uncertain**  
   - **Correlator over-grouping / instrumentation artifact:** 171 metrics in one cluster suggests the correlator may be clustering “everything changed” rather than identifying a tight causal chain; many metrics are `:count` and shift 1→2, which can happen from a single discrete event.  
   - **Container lifecycle event (pause/freeze/stop/restart) rather than pure resource exhaustion:** presence of `cgroup.events.frozen`/`cgroup.freeze` anomalies could reflect runtime/management actions during termination; those can coincide with OOM if the pod is being killed/restarted.  
   - **Host-level pressure affecting the container:** CPU PSI anomalies could be driven by node contention; without node-level context and the actual magnitudes (only “shifted 1→2”), it’s hard to separate container-caused vs externally-imposed contention.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - OOM-related anomalies:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom_group_kill:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (appears multiple timestamps)  
     - Correlation title references `...memory.events.oom:count` and includes many memory event sources.
   - Strong memory pressure signals:  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg300:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - Correlated cluster includes `memory.pressure.full.*` and `memory.pressure.some.*` totals/avgs.
   - CPU contention present at same time:  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10/avg60:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - Cluster includes many `cpu.pressure.*` and throttling stats (`cpu.stat.nr_throttled`, `throttled_usec`, etc.).
   - Process/limits signals co-occur:  
     - `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
     - Cluster includes `pids.current`, `pids.events.max`, `container.pid_count`.
   - Container is **BestEffort** (more prone to eviction/OOM under contention):  
     - Tags show `qos_class:BestEffort` for the anomalous sources.
   - Timing suggests a single incident window:  
     - Correlation cluster `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768513987`, while sample anomalies occur around `1768513989–1768513990` (tight burst around one event window).
