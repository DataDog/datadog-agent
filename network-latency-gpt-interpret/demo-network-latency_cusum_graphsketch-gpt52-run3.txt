============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All 171 anomalous metrics moved together as one tight cluster in the same short window, implying a single underlying container-level event (not independent metric failures). The strongest co-occurrence is between cgroup “frozen” events and memory OOM events, suggesting lifecycle/kill activity coincident with memory pressure and resulting secondary CPU/IO pressure signals.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
Yes.

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
The `cleanup` container hit memory pressure and was OOM-killed (group kill), causing a cascade of correlated anomalies across CPU pressure, memory stats/pressure, and related cgroup counters.

4) **Confidence level**  
High.

5) **If not high confidence: alternatives & uncertainty**  
N/A.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- Explicit OOM indicators: `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count` and `...oom_group_kill:count` shifted `1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (multiple timestamps).  
- Correlation headline: “**cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom:count** (freq: 10560.0, 171 sources)” indicating strong co-occurrence.  
- Memory pressure present: `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10:count` and `...avg300:count` shifted `1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
- CPU pressure also present: `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10/avg60:count` shifted `1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
- Process/activity change concurrent: `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count` shifted `1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
- All anomalies share the same container context in samples: `container_name:cleanup`, `qos_class:BestEffort` (more likely to be reclaimed/OOMed under node pressure).
