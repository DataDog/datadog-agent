PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   GraphSketch found a single very large co-anomaly cluster (184 metrics) where CPU, memory, IO, pids, and cgroup state/event counters tend to anomaly together within ~10 seconds—i.e., one “system-wide/container-wide disturbance” rather than isolated metric glitches.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   A short, intense **resource-pressure event** affecting multiple containers—dominated by **memory pressure (swap/zswap/thrashing) with accompanying CPU/IO pressure**, consistent with a transient near-OOM / heavy reclaim episode.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain?**  
   - **Metrics collection/reset artifact or counter discontinuity**: many anomalies have an extreme identical score (1e10) across many counters, which can happen when counters reset, scrape gaps occur, or units change.  
   - **Container lifecycle event (restart/freeze/unfreeze/cgroup repopulation)**: anomalies include cgroup freeze/frozen/populated and procs/descendants metrics, which can all change abruptly during restarts or orchestrator actions.  
   - **Workload-driven memory mapping change (THP/hugetlb/smaps shifts) without true “fault”**: the edge list is dominated by smaps_rollup correlations, which can move together during normal phase changes (alloc/mmap, JIT, cache warmup).  
   Uncertainty is mainly because the JSON shows co-anomalies and co-occurrence edges, but not the *direction/magnitude* of changes nor explicit confirmation that OOM_kill happened (only “oom” is in the correlated source list, not shown in sample anomalies).

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Single correlation cluster covering almost everything**: `total_correlations: 1`, cluster has `source_count: 184` with title mentioning **`cgroup...frozen` ↔ `cgroup...memory.events.oom`** and very high `freq: 107478.6`.  
   - **Memory pressure / reclaim / swap indicators anomalous** (samples):  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.swap.events.max:count` (todo-frontend)  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.workingset_refault_anon:count` (todo-backend)  
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswpin:count` (todo-redis)  
     - THP-related shifts: `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.anon_thp:count`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.file_thp:count`  
   - **CPU/IO pressure indicators anomalous** (samples):  
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10:count` (cleanup)  
     - `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.avg60:count` (todo-frontend)  
     - `kernel_cpu_percentage:count` (cleanup)  
   - **Abrupt cgroup/process state changes** (samples):  
     - `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs:count` (todo-backend)  
     - `cgroup.v2.cgroup.stat.nr_descendants:count` (todo-backend)  
     - Cluster includes `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen/populated` and `cgroup.v2.cgroup.freeze`.  
   - **Cross-container impact**: sample anomalies span multiple pods/containers (`todo-backend`, `todo-frontend`, `todo-redis`, `cleanup`) in the same namespace.
