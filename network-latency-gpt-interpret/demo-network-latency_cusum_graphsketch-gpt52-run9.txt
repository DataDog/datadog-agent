PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All detected anomalies are essentially one co-occurring cluster: when one metric goes abnormal, *many* CPU, memory, IO-pressure, pids, hugetlb, and smaps metrics go abnormal within the same ~10s window—consistent with a single container-level disturbance affecting the whole cgroup (not independent, unrelated issues).

2) **Is there a problem?**  
**Yes.**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
A BestEffort container (`cleanup`) hit severe memory pressure leading to OOM events (including OOM group kills), with associated system-wide pressure/side-effects (CPU/IO pressure and paging activity) during the incident.

4) **Confidence level**  
**Medium.**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities + why uncertain**  
- **Metric/collection artifact or counter-step effect**: many anomalies are “shifted 1→2” on `:count` series, which can happen if the detector is treating monotonically increasing counters as “level” signals; this can inflate “everything changed” clusters.  
- **Container lifecycle/restart/freeze-unfreeze event**: the cluster includes cgroup freeze/frozen/populated signals; a stop/start or orchestrator action could cause widespread counter increments and transient pressure.  
- **Host-level contention rather than app bug**: CPU pressure full metrics could be driven by node contention; without node-level context and actual values (not just counter increments), root cause could be outside the container.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Direct OOM indicators:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom_group_kill:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (repeated at adjacent timestamps)
- **Memory pressure signals:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg300:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.high:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
- **CPU pressure signals:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10/avg60:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
- **Process pressure / growth:**  
  - `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
- **Single correlated cluster covering many subsystems:**  
  - One correlation group with **171 sources**: `"graphsketch_cluster_0" ... (freq: 10560.0, 171 sources)`
- **All anomalies tied to same workload identity in samples:**  
  - Tags repeatedly show `container_name:cleanup`, `qos_class:BestEffort`, same `container_id`, same namespace/pod.
