============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All detected anomalies collapse into one large co-occurring cluster (171 metrics) spanning CPU pressure/throttling, memory pressure/stat counters, OOM events, hugetlb events, pids, and even cgroup freeze/populated signals—i.e., a single “incident window” where many container-level subsystems changed together rather than isolated metric noise.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The container hit severe memory pressure leading to OOM (group kill) and broader resource contention (CPU pressure, possibly throttling/pid growth) consistent with a runaway workload or leak in a BestEffort container.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Counter/timestamp artifact or restart effects:** Many anomalies are “shifted 1→2” on `:count` metrics (event counters), which can all flip together from a single event or from baseline-learning quirks; without raw values/time-series context it’s hard to judge magnitude/duration.  
   - **Kubernetes lifecycle events (freeze/kill/evict) rather than app bug:** Presence of `cgroup.events.frozen` / `cgroup.freeze` in the correlated cluster could reflect orchestrator actions during termination/eviction, which would also coincide with OOM and resource pressure.  
   - **Node-level contention:** CPU pressure anomalies could be driven by noisy neighbors on the node; BestEffort QoS makes the container more vulnerable, but we can’t confirm node saturation from this snippet alone.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - OOM signals: `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count shifted 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` and `...oom_group_kill:count shifted 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (multiple timestamps around `1768513989–1768513990`).  
   - Memory pressure: `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10/avg300:count shifted 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` and memory “high” events `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.high:count shifted 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
   - CPU pressure: `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10/avg60:count shifted 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
   - Process growth/limits involvement: `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count shifted 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`.  
   - The correlator found **one** dominant cluster: `graphsketch_cluster_0 ... (171 sources)` tying together CPU/memory/io pressure + OOM + pids + hugetlb + smaps metrics in the same window (`first_seen 1768513985`, `last_updated 1768513987`).  
   - Workload is **BestEffort** (more likely to be OOM-killed under contention): tags include `qos_class:BestEffort` for the anomalous container.
