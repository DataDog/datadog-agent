============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All anomalies collapsed into a single large co-occurrence cluster (171 metrics) that moved together in the same short window, meaning the event affected the container broadly (CPU pressure, memory pressure/stat counters, OOM events, pids, hugetlb, IO pressure), consistent with a systemic disruption rather than one isolated metric.

2. **Is there a problem?**  
   **Yes.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   The `cleanup` container was driven into **memory pressure leading to an OOM/oom_group_kill (and likely container disruption/restart), with concurrent CPU pressure and broad memory accounting shifts**.

4. **Confidence level**  
   **Medium.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities / why uncertain**  
   - **Metric artifacts / step-change from counters:** Many “shifted 1 → 2 (10σ)” are *count/counter-like* metrics; a single increment can look like a big baseline shift to CUSUM, inflating correlation size.  
   - **Lifecycle event (freeze/thaw/recreate) rather than pure resource exhaustion:** The cluster title references `cgroup...frozen` and many cgroup config/limit fields appear in the correlated set; a container/pod transition could cause many metrics to change together.  
   - **Node-level contention cascading into the container:** CPU pressure anomalies could reflect host contention while the OOM could be from the container limit or host reclaim behavior; without actual values for `memory.current` vs `memory.max`, causality is not fully provable.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Explicit OOM signals:**
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom_group_kill:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (appears multiple times)
   - **Memory pressure signals:**
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
     - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg300:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
     - correlation sources include `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.*` and `cgroup.v2.memory.events.* (high/max/oom*)`
   - **CPU pressure concurrent with the event:**
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg60:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
     - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
   - **Process/pids involvement:**
     - `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`
     - correlation sources include `cgroup.v2.pids.current/max/peak/events.max` and `container.pid_count`
   - **Single correlated “everything moved” cluster:**
     - `total_correlations: 1`, cluster has `source_count: 171`
     - Cluster title: `Correlated: cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom:count`
   - **Scope / identity:**
     - anomalies tagged to `container_name:cleanup`, `qos_class:BestEffort` (more eviction/OOM-prone)
