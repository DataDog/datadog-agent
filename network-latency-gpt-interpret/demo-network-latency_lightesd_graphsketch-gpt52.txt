PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All 184 metrics that showed anomalies are being grouped into a single co-occurring cluster, meaning the detector saw a short time window where *many* cgroup/memory/CPU/I/O/smaps metrics deviated together; this looks like a systemic event (or a shared measurement artifact) rather than one isolated metric issue.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
**Unclear**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
N/A

4) **Confidence level**  
**Low**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
- **Real resource-pressure incident (memory pressure → swap/PSI/oom signals)**: plausible because the cluster title highlights `memory.events.oom` and the sample anomalies include swap and PSI; but we don’t see actual values, counts, or whether OOM events truly incremented vs just “changed.”  
- **Container lifecycle churn (pods restarting / cgroups recreated)**: many “count” metrics (e.g., `cgroup.procs`, descendants) can jump/reset when cgroups are created/destroyed; the anomalies are concentrated in a tight time range (~50s).  
- **Metrics collection/processing artifact** (scrape gap, counter reset, unit/label change): extremely high identical scores (`1e10`) across many metrics at the same timestamps strongly suggests a systemic detection artifact rather than diverse organic outliers.  
Uncertainty is high because the output lacks raw metric values/directions and because “count” series often behave like counters that naturally spike/reset.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Single huge correlated cluster:** `total_correlations: 1`, `source_count: 184`, title: *“Correlated: cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom (freq: 107478.6, 184 sources)”*  
- **Very tight timing:** `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768514033` (~48 seconds).  
- **Signals consistent with pressure/lifecycle:** sample anomalies include `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10`, `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.avg60`, `cgroup.v2.memory.swap.events.max`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.workingset_refault_anon`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs`, `nr_descendants`.  
- **Systemic/anomalous scoring pattern:** multiple sample anomalies have the exact same extreme score `10000000000.00`, often at the same timestamp (`1768513985` / `1768514035`).  
- **Edges dominated by smaps_rollup internals:** many high-frequency edges between smaps fields (e.g., `anon_huge_pages` ↔ `private_dirty` / `shared_clean`), which can all move together from a single memory mapping change or from collection quirks.
