PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context

1. **What do the correlations tell you?**  
   All detected anomalies across **184 metrics** were treated as one highly co-occurring cluster, meaning the system saw a single time window where *many* CPU/memory/IO/cgroup/smaps signals changed together rather than a few isolated outliers.

2. **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
   **Unclear.**

3. **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
   N/A.

4. **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
   **Low.**

5. **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
   - **Instrumentation/collection artifact or resync:** Many “:count” gauges/counters (e.g., `memory.max`, `pids.max`, `cpu.weight`) should be mostly stable; simultaneous “anomalies” across them can happen if the collector restarted, labels changed, cgroups were recreated, or values briefly became missing/zero and then returned.  
   - **Container lifecycle event (rollout/restart/cleanup job):** Metrics like `cgroup.procs`, `nr_descendants`, and `cgroup.events.populated/frozen` can jump when containers start/stop; if multiple pods changed around the same seconds, GraphSketch will cluster everything.  
   - **Real node-level memory pressure/eviction episode:** The cluster title highlights `memory.events.oom` and there are swap/zswap and PSI signals, which *could* indicate genuine pressure, but the provided samples don’t show the actual OOM counts increasing—only that those metrics were anomalous.  
   **Uncertain because** the output shows *anomaly flags and co-occurrence*, not the underlying metric values/directions (increase vs reset), nor whether OOM counters actually incremented, nor whether this was node-wide vs per-container.

6. **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
   - **Mass co-occurrence:** `total_anomalies: 8716`, `unique_sources_in_anomalies: 184`, `total_correlations: 1` with `source_count: 184` (everything lumped together).  
   - **Cluster anchored on OOM/freeze signals:** correlation title: `cgroup.v2.cgroup.events.frozen:count ↔ cgroup.v2.memory.events.oom:count`.  
   - **Timing suggests a short burst:** `first_seen: 1768513985`, `last_updated: 1768514033` (~48 seconds).  
   - **Pressure/swap indicators appear in samples:** `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10`, `cgroup.v2.io.pressure.full.avg60`, `cgroup.v2.memory.swap.events.max`, `cgroup.v2.memory.stat.zswpin`.  
   - **Lifecycle-ish metrics anomalous in samples:** `cgroup.v2.cgroup.procs`, `cgroup.v2.cgroup.stat.nr_descendants`, `cgroup.v2.pids.max` (often stable unless cgroup recreated/config changed).  
   - **GraphSketch edges dominated by smaps_rollup co-anomalies** (e.g., thousands of observations among `smaps_rollup.*`), consistent with “many metrics moved together,” but not specific to a single root cause.
