PROMPT (context only, JSON data omitted):
============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**CUSUM Detector:**
Detects sustained shifts from baseline using cumulative sum of deviations.
- Learns "normal" from first 25% of data
- Accumulates "debt" when values deviate from normal
- Triggers when cumulative deviation exceeds threshold
- Good for: gradual changes, memory leaks, sustained CPU increases
- Not good for: brief spikes that quickly return to normal


**GraphSketch Correlator:**
Learns which metrics frequently anomaly together over time.
- Tracks "edges" (pairs of metrics that co-occur within 10 seconds)
- Counts co-occurrence frequency with time decay (recent matters more)
- Reports edges with observation counts and frequency scores
- Good for: finding root causes, understanding metric relationships
- Slower processing, learns patterns over time


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

RESPONSE:
============================================================
1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
All detected anomalies collapse into a single large co-occurring cluster (171 metrics) spanning CPU pressure/throttling, memory pressure/stat/events (including OOM), I/O pressure, pids, and smaps—i.e., one container experienced a broad, simultaneous resource-stress episode rather than isolated metric glitches.

2) **Is there a problem?**  
Yes.

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
The `cleanup` container (BestEffort) hit severe memory pressure culminating in OOM/oom_group_kill, with accompanying CPU pressure and other resource contention signals.

4) **Confidence level**  
High.

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and uncertainty**  
N/A.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- Memory OOM signals:  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.oom_group_kill:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)` (appears multiple times)  
- Memory pressure signals:  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.pressure.some.avg300:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.memory.events.local.high:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- CPU contention signals:  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg60:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
  - `cgroup.v2.cpu.pressure.full.avg10:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- Process/resource stress indicator:  
  - `cgroup.v2.pids.peak:count shifted: 1.00 → 2.00 (10.0σ)`  
- Correlator output indicates one unified event across the system’s resource subsystems:  
  - Single correlation: `graphsketch_cluster_0` with **171 sources**; title explicitly links `...frozen...` ↔ `...memory.events.oom...` and includes CPU/memory/I/O pressure metrics.  
- Scoped to a single workload: tags on sample anomalies consistently point to `container_name:cleanup`, `qos_class:BestEffort`, same namespace/pod/container_id.
