============================================================
This is anomaly detection output from Linux container metrics (cgroup v2, smaps, CPU, memory, I/O).

The data was processed by two components:
1. An anomaly detector (identifies abnormal metric values)
2. A correlator (groups anomalies that occur together)


**LightESD Detector:**
Detects statistical outliers using robust methods.
- Removes trend (if values generally go up/down)
- Removes seasonality (hourly/daily patterns)
- Finds points statistically far from the median
- Uses robust stats (median, MAD) to avoid being fooled by outliers
- Good for: sudden spikes, brief anomalies in noisy data
- Not good for: gradual shifts


**TimeCluster Correlator:**
Groups metrics that anomaly at the exact same time (within 1 second).
- Simple temporal grouping, no learning
- Creates clusters of simultaneous anomalies
- Good for: quick grouping during incidents
- Fast processing, but doesn't understand relationships


**JSON fields:**
- total_anomalies: How many anomaly events were detected
- unique_sources_in_anomalies: How many different metrics had anomalies
- correlations: Groups of metrics that anomalied together
- edges (if GraphSketch): Pairs of metrics and how often they co-occurred
- sample_anomalies: A few example anomalies for context


[JSON data omitted]

1) **What do the correlations tell you?**  
- There are a few short time windows where *almost every metric* across CPU/memory/I/O/cgroup metadata flagged as anomalous at the same timestamps (largest cluster: **267 sources**), plus a smaller cluster affecting only “avg” CPU/memory signals. This looks like a **global, synchronous anomaly**, not an isolated container symptom.

2) **Is there a problem? (yes/no/unclear)**  
- **Unclear**

3) **If yes, what is it? (one sentence)**  
- N/A

4) **Confidence level (high/medium/low)**  
- **Low**

5) **If not high confidence: alternative possibilities and why uncertain**  
- **Metrics pipeline/collection artifact** (most likely): simultaneous anomalies across hundreds of unrelated metrics commonly happens with scrape gaps, timestamp jitter, counter resets, unit/schema changes, or exporter restarts; TimeCluster will then group everything. Uncertain because raw values/baselines aren’t shown—only anomaly “scores.”  
- **Node-level incident**: a brief host stall or resource contention event (CPU+memory+I/O pressure) could cause broad anomalies, but we don’t see clear “pressure goes high” values, just that pressure metrics were flagged.  
- **Container lifecycle churn**: cgroup “populated/frozen/procs/max.depth/descendants” anomalies could come from rapid container creation/teardown; that can also perturb many derived metrics. Uncertain because correlation is time-only and doesn’t confirm causal linkage or magnitude.

6) **Supporting evidence (from the data)**  
- **Very large synchronous cluster:** `time_cluster_8` has **267 sources** spanning cgroup metadata, CPU, memory, I/O, and smaps; window **1768514043–1768514078**.  
- **Repeated near-identical big clusters around adjacent seconds:** `time_cluster_2`..`time_cluster_6` each have **184 sources** with `first_seen` **1768514033–1768514042** (1-second steps), suggesting repeated global alignment rather than one subsystem.  
- **Smaller “avg-only” cluster:** `time_cluster_20541` has **25 avg metrics** (CPU usage/percentages, memory.current avg, smaps pss/rss avg) in **1768514020–1768514030**, consistent with a sampling/aggregation disruption.  
- **Extremely high anomaly scores on structural/count-ish signals:** e.g., `cgroup.v2.cgroup.max.depth:count` score **1e10**; `smaps_rollup.pss:avg` score **1.35e15**—scores that often show up when baselines break (resets/missing/constant-to-nonconstant).  
- **Multiple containers involved in samples:** anomalies appear across `cleanup`, `todo-frontend`, `todo-backend`, `todo-redis`, indicating it’s not isolated to one workload.
