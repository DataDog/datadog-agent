EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosis focuses on “**memory-pressure episode leading to OOM activity**”, “**cgroup freeze/frozen events**”, “**swap/zswap activity**”, and PSI pressure; no mention of network latency/delay/slow network/Redis networking.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis missed the injected network latency fault and instead attributed the incident to memory pressure/OOM and cgroup-related resource issues.
