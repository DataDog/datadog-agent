EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: It says “**Unclear**,” focuses on “**baseline/training artifact**,” “**metric collection change / restart**,” and “**workload shift**,” with no mention of network latency/delay/slow network.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify network latency and instead treated the event as an unclear broad metric shift likely due to baseline or collection artifacts.
