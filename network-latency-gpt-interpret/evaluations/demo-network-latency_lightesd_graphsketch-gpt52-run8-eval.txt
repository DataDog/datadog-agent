EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosis focuses on “container-level memory pressure culminating in OOM events and/or cgroup freeze activity” and says “Unclear,” with no mention of network latency/delay/slow network.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis missed the injected network latency and instead attributed anomalies to OOM/cgroup freeze or instrumentation artifacts.
