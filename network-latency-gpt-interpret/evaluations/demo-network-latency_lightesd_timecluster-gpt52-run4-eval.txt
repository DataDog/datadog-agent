EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: Focused on “metrics collection artifact,” “scrape/reset/collect issue,” “cgroup lifecycle events,” and explicitly said “Problem? Unclear,” with no mention of network latency/delay.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis missed the injected Redis network latency and instead attributed the anomalies to telemetry/collection or lifecycle artifacts.
