EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: It says “**Unclear**,” gives “**Monitoring / collection artifact**,” “**instrumentation**,” “**CUSUM baseline mismatch**,” and no mention of “network,” “latency,” “delay,” or Redis/network symptoms.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify network latency and instead attributed the anomalies to potential measurement/regime-change artifacts.
