Checking if diagnosis identified: network latency...

============================================================
EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosis claims “memory pressure and was OOM-killed (group kill)” with “cgroup…memory.events…oom” and “frozen events,” and contains no mention of network latency/delay/slow network.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis completely misclassified the issue as an OOM/memory-pressure container event rather than the injected Redis network latency.
