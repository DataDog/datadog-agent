Checking if diagnosis identified: network latency...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: Focuses on “memory/pressure/smaps metrics,” “cgroup freeze/frozen events,” and “memory OOM events,” and explicitly says “Unclear,” with no mention of network latency/delay/slow network.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis missed the injected Redis network latency and instead discussed possible memory/oom/freeze artifacts and broad metric storms.
