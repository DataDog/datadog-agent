EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: Mentions “systemic step-change or measurement artifact,” “Instrumentation/scrape/reset artifact,” “Node-level disruption,” and concludes “Unclear”; no mention of “network latency/delay/slow network.”  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis missed the injected Redis network latency and instead attributed the pattern to metric collection artifacts or node-level disruption.
