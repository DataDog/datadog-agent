EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosed “severe memory pressure leading to OOM (group kill)” with CPU pressure/throttling and pids growth; no mention of “network latency/delay/slow network/packet” anywhere.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis attributes the incident to memory/OOM and resource contention, completely missing the actual injected Redis network latency fault.
