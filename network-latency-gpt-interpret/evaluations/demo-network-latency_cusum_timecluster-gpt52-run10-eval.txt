Checking if diagnosis identified: network latency...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: It explicitly says “**Unclear**” and gives alternatives like “baseline/training artifact,” “deployment/load increase,” and “telemetry behavior,” with **no mention of network latency/delay**.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify network latency and instead treated the signal as nonspecific/anomalous telemetry or a generic system-wide shift.
