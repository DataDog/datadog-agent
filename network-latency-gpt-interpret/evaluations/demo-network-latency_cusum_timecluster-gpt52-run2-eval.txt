EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: It says “Unclear” / “N/A” and discusses “CPU and memory increases,” “baseline/training artifact,” “instrumentation,” and “container lifecycle churn,” with no mention of network latency/delay/packet issues.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify network latency and instead concluded the issue was unclear, focusing on broad metric shifts and potential detector/artifact explanations.
