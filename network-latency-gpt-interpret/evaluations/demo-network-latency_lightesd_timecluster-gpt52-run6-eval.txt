Checking if diagnosis identified: network latency...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: It says “systemic/collection-layer event,” “metrics collection/reset artifact,” “node/container runtime event,” and “Real resource incident,” with no mention of “network,” “latency,” “delay,” or similar.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis missed the injected network latency and instead attributed the anomaly pattern to metric collection or lifecycle/reset effects with low confidence.
