EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosed “severe memory pressure leading to OOM (including OOM group kills)” with “CPU pressure/pid changes”; no mention of “network latency/delay/slow network/packet” anywhere.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis completely missed the injected network latency fault and instead attributed the issue to memory/OOM and resource pressure.
