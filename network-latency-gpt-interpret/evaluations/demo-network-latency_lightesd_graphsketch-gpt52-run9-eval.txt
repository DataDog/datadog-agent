EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: Focused on “memory pressure / OOM / swapping / IO pressure,” “container lifecycle/restart,” “metrics pipeline/scrape issue,” and stated “Unclear,” with no mention of network latency/delay.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis missed the injected network latency and instead discussed broad systemic/memory/metrics-artifact possibilities.
