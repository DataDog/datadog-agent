EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: It attributes the issue to “**memory pressure leading to OOM kills**” and “resource exhaustion,” with no mention of network latency/delay/Redis networking.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis misses the injected network latency fault entirely and instead concludes an OOM/memory-pressure event.
