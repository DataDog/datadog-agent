EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosis focuses on “severe memory pressure culminating in OOM/oom_group_kill” plus “CPU pressure” and “resource contention,” with no mention of latency/delay/network.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis completely missed the injected network latency fault and instead attributed the issue to memory/OOM and CPU pressure in the `cleanup` container.
