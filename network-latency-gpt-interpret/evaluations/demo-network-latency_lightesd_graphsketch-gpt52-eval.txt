EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: It says “**Unclear**” and discusses “**memory pressure → swap/PSI/oom**,” “**container lifecycle churn**,” and “**metrics collection/processing artifact**,” with no mention of network latency/delay.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify network latency and instead focused on memory/oom or artifact explanations.
