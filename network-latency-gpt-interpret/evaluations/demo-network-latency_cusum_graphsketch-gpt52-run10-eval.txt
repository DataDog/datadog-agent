Checking if diagnosis identified: network latency...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Focused on “severe memory pressure culminating in OOM and OOM group kills” with “CPU pressure/throttling,” no mention of network latency/delay/Redis networking.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis attributes the incident to container memory/CPU resource starvation and OOM events, completely missing the true root cause of injected network latency on the Redis pod.
