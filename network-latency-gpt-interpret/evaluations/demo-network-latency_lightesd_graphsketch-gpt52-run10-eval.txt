Checking if diagnosis identified: network latency...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosed “resource-pressure event… dominated by memory pressure (swap/zswap/thrashing)… near-OOM / heavy reclaim episode,” with no mention of “network latency/delay/slow network/tc/netem.”  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis completely missed the injected Redis network latency and instead attributed the symptoms to memory/CPU/IO pressure and possible metric artifacts.
