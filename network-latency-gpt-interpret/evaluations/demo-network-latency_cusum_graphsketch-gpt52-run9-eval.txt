Checking if diagnosis identified: network latency...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosed “severe memory pressure leading to OOM events (OOM group kills)” and discussed CPU/IO pressure; no mention of network latency/delay/slow network.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis completely missed the injected network-latency fault and instead attributed the issue to container memory pressure/OOM.
