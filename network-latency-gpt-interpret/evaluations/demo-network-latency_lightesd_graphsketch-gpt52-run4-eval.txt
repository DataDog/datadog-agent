Checking if diagnosis identified: network latency...

EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: It states “**Unclear**” and discusses “**instrumentation/collection artifact**,” “**container lifecycle event**,” and “**memory pressure/eviction/OOM**,” with no mention of network latency/delay/slow network.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify the injected Redis network latency and instead focused on broad metric co-occurrence with alternative explanations unrelated to network delay.
