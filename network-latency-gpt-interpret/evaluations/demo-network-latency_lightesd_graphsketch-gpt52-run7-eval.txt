EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosis says “**Unclear**” and focuses on “**Metrics pipeline / scrape artifact**,” “**host-level disruption**,” “**containers restarting**,” with no mention of network “latency/delay/slow network.”  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify network latency and instead attributed the anomalies to a global metrics/artifact or system-wide event.
