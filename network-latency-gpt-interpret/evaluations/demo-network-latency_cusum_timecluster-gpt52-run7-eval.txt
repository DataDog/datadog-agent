EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 5  
3. **Evidence**: It says “Unclear” and discusses “global baseline/collection change,” “monitoring/baseline artifact,” “container lifecycle/rollout,” and “node-wide resource event,” with no mention of network latency/delay.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify network latency and instead treated the signal as an ambiguous, system-wide metrics shift or instrumentation artifact.
