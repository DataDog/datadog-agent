EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: Diagnosis focuses on “monitoring/baseline reset or environment-wide state change,” “systemic collection/baseline/change-point artifact,” and “CPU/memory pressure event,” with no mention of network latency/delay.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis did not identify the injected Redis network latency and instead attributed anomalies to monitoring/baseline artifacts or broad system changes.
