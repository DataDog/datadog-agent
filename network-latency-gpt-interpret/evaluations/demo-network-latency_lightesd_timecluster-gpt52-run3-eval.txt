EVALUATION RESULT:
============================================================
1. **Identified Problem**: no - Did it identify network latency?  
2. **Score**: 10  
3. **Evidence**: It says “**Unclear**,” “**Telemetry/collector artifact**,” “**container/pod churn**,” and “**node-level incident**,” with **no mention of network latency/delay**.  
4. **Summary**: The diagnosis completely missed the injected network latency and instead focused on broad metric co-occurrence and possible telemetry/container lifecycle artifacts.
