package proto

// These imports are used to track test and build protobuf tool dependencies.
// This is the currently recommended approach: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module

// NOTE: This package might become obsolete once we can unpin some of the dependencies here listed.
//       At that point it could be wise to merge these back to internal/tools.
//       Though a protobuf dependency, protodep is tracked in internal/tools due to versioning
//       conflicts with the pins set here.
