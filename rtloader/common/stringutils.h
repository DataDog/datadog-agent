/*! \file stringutils.h
    \brief RtLoader String Utilities header file.

    The prototypes here defined provide a set of helper functions to convert between
    strings in their C representation and respective python objects. This includes native
    strings but also YAML representations of python objects - allowing for serialization.
    Please make sure to properly initialize stringutils before using.
*/
/*! \fn int init_stringutils(void)
    \brief Initializes stringutils; grabbing and caching the python relevant pyyaml objects.
    \return int The success of the operation `EXIT_SUCCESS` (0) or `EXIT_FAILURE` (1).
    \sa as_yaml, from_yaml

    The function must be called before using the yaml helper functions in the module.
    Typically this is expected to be done during initialization. The routine grabs the
    pyyaml load and dump method references, and attempts to grab references to the pyyaml
    C-extension CSafeLoader and CSafeDumper, these are more performant, but more importantly
    do not incur in a 30Mb unnecessary RSS excess. If the C-extensions are not available
    it falls back to its python variants: SafeLoader and SafeDumper. They're all cached
    and so `as_yaml`, and `from_yaml1` will not need to grab new references and will be able
    to call them directly.
*/
/*! \fn char *as_string(PyObject * object)
    \brief Returns a Python object representation for the supplied YAML C-string.
    \param object The YAML C-string representation of the object we wish to deserialize.
    \return char * representation of the supplied string. In case of error NULL is returned.

    The returned C-string is allocated by this function and should subsequently be freed by
    the caller. This function should not set errors on the python interpreter.
*/
/*! \fn PyObject *from_yaml(const char * object)
    \brief Returns a Python object representation for the supplied YAML C-string.
    \param object The YAML C-string representation of the object we wish to deserialize.
    \return PyObject * pointer to the python object representation of the supplied yaml C
    string. In case of error, NULL will be returned.

    The returned Python object is a new reference and should subsequently be DECREF'd when
    no longer used, wanted by the caller.
*/
/*! \fn char *as_yaml(PyObject * object)
    \brief Returns a C string YAML representation for the supplied Python object.
    \param object The python object whose YAML representation we want.
    \return char * pointer to the C-string representation for the supplied Python object.
    In case of error, NULL will be returned.

    The returned C-string YAML representation is allocated by the function and should
    be subsequently freed by the caller.
*/
/*! \def PyStringFromCString(x)
    \brief A macro that returns a Python string from C string x (char *).

    This macro is implemented differently in the Python2 and Python3 variants.
    For Python2 this macro wraps and calls PyString_FromString(x).
    For Python3 this macro wraps and calls PyUnicode_FromString(x).
