# this file contains overrides for the automatic determination of copyright
# implemented in tasks/licenses.py.  The table keys are the golang package name
# or pattern, and the value is either a copyright owner or a list of owners.
#
# Package patterns may end with a `*`.  When multiple patterns match, the longer
# is preferred.
#
# Copyright statements should reflect the copyright exactly as it is shown on
# the original component.

# NOTE: in general, we prefer to pull data from the repository so that it will
# be updated automatically, so prefer to make such a change in
# tasks/licenses.py if possible.  Line-wrapping can be difficult to handle, and
# may be overridden here.

# These whole classes of package names have fixed copyright
