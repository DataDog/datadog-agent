# this file contains overrides for the automatic determination of copyright
# implemented in tasks/licenses.py.  The table keys are the golang package name
# or pattern, and the value is either a copyright owner or a list of owners.
#
# Package patterns may end with a `*`.  When multiple patterns match, the longer
# is preferred.
#
# Copyright statements should reflect the copyright exactly as it is shown on
# the original component.

# NOTE: in general, we prefer to pull data from the repository so that it will
# be updated automatically, so prefer to make such a change in
# tasks/licenses.py if possible.  Line-wrapping can be difficult to handle, and
# may be overridden here.

# These whole classes of package names have fixed copyright

# FIXME(AP-2060): inv generate-licenses and inv lint-licenses can generate invalid csv
# while parsing some files. For instance, in the README.md of github.com/klauspost/compress/s2,
# there is an example section which contains:
#    // We are only interested in the contents.
#    // Assume that files start with "// Copyright (c) 2023".
#    // Search for the longest match for that.
#    // This may save a few bytes.
#    dict := s2.MakeDict(insp.Content(), []byte("// Copyright (c) 2023"))
# This causes the tasks to add 'Copyright (c) 2023". | Copyright (c) 2023"))' to the copyright
# information for that file, resulting in an invalid csv (due to the quotes).
# Until this is fixed, override the copyright value to avoid parsing these files.
