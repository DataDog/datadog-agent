# Deploying Host Profiler with the Datadog Helm chart

## Overview

Use this guide when the Datadog Agent is already installed with Helm. This includes Datadog Agent deployments that also run the Datadog Distribution of OpenTelemetry (DDOT). If your Agent is managed by the Datadog Operator, use the [Datadog Operator guide](operator.md) instead.

The Host Profiler runs as a sidecar in the Datadog Agent DaemonSet, and the Agent enriches profiles with Datadog infrastructure metadata.

Review the [supported environments](../README.md#supported-environments) before continuing.

## Prerequisites

Deploy the Datadog Agent with the Datadog Helm chart version **3.220.0** or later. See the [Datadog Agent installation guide](https://app.datadoghq.com/fleet/install-agent/latest?platform=kubernetes).

## Deploy

1. Add the Host Profiler configuration to the `values.yaml` file for your Datadog Agent Helm release:

```yaml
datadog:
  hostProfiler:
    enabled: true
    image: "registry.datadoghq.com/ddot-ebpf:7.81.0-preview-host-profiler-1.0"
agents:
  containers:
    hostProfiler:
      # Explicit zero requests avoid reserving CPU or memory on every node,
      # while limits cap runaway usage.
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "0"
          memory: "0"
        limits:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "1Gi"
```

The preview image is available in Datadog's production container registries. If your cluster pulls images from another Datadog registry, replace the `registry.datadoghq.com` prefix with your preferred registry prefix. See [Changing your container registry](https://docs.datadoghq.com/containers/guide/changing_container_registry/).

For expected overhead, default limits, and tuning guidance, see [Overhead and resource usage](../faq.md#what-overhead-should-i-expect).

2. Upgrade your existing Datadog Agent Helm release with the updated values. Adapt this command to your Helm or GitOps workflow, and include any existing values files you already use for the release:

```shell
helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> datadog/datadog \
  --namespace <NAMESPACE> \
  --values values.yaml
```

The Datadog Helm chart configures the required capabilities and seccomp profile automatically.

The Host Profiler infers most configuration from the Datadog Agent configuration. For optional overrides, see [Configuration](configuration.md).

After you apply the updated values, Helm rolls out a new Agent DaemonSet revision with the Host Profiler sidecar. Wait for that rollout to complete before verifying profiles.

After deploying the Host Profiler, profiles appear on the [Datadog Profiler](https://app.datadoghq.com/profiling) page within a few minutes. If profiles do not appear, see the [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) guide.

## AppArmor (optional)

AppArmor provides extra hardening on Linux distributions and Kubernetes clusters where AppArmor is available. The Host Profiler does not require AppArmor to run.

Use this section only if your nodes support AppArmor and you already manage node-local AppArmor profiles. AppArmor profiles must be loaded on each node before Kubernetes can apply them to a pod.

To enable the provided profile, load [`apparmor-profile`](../apparmor-profile) on each node, then set:

```yaml
datadog:
  hostProfiler:
    apparmor: localhost/host-profiler
```

The provided profile limits what the Host Profiler container can execute. It allows `objcopy`, which is used for debug symbol extraction.
