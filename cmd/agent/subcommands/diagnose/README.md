# ```agent diagnose``` CLI command

```agent diagnose``` command is one of the Agent CLI commands ([agent other commands](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/agent-commands/?tab=agentv6v7#other-commands)). It runs internal self-diagnostic tests and outputs their results and if problems are found report them (and in some cases remediation steps).

### ```include``` and ```exclude``` options
agent diagnose --include and or --exclude options allow to filter to specific diagnose suites

### ```list``` option
List names of all registered diagnose suites. Output also will be filtered if include and or exclude options are specified.

### ```verbose``` option
Normally a successful diagnosis is printed as a single dot character. If verbose option is specified successful diagnosis is printed fully. With verbose option diagnosis description is also printed.

### ```local``` option
Normally internal diagnose functions will run in the context of agent and other services. It can be overridden via â€“run-as-user options and if specified diagnose functions will be executed in context of the agent diagnose CLI process if possible.
