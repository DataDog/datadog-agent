init_config:
  ## The Windows kernel memory check lists the top users of kernel memory by pool tag.
  ## for each of the four metrics, configure the top N results to be reported.  The
  ## default for all is 10.

  ## topPagedBytes: N report the top N pool tag consumers of paged memory
  # topPagedBytes: 8

  ## topNonPagedBytes: N report the top N pool tag consumers of non-paged memory
  # topNonPagedBytes: 5

  ## topPagedAllocsOutstanding: N report the pool tag with the top number of allocations
  ## outstanding (allocations minus frees).  This can be different from the topPagedBytes
  ## if there are many small allocations (vs. a few large)
  # topPagedAllocsOutstanding: 5

  ## topNonPagedAllocsOutstanding: N  report the pool tag with the top number of non-paged
  ## allocations outstanding
  # topNonPagedAllocsOutstanding: 5

  ## alloctags is a list of specific pool tags that should be reported regardless of whether
  ## that tag is a top consumer
  # alloctags:
  # - Tag1
  # - Tag2

# There is only one instance of the check; there is no instance configuration
instances:
