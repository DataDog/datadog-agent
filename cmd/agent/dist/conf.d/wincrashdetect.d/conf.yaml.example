instances:

    ## the Windows crash detection check will send an event if a system crash is detected
    ## since the last time the agent is run.  It will send a single event for a given crash;
    ## if the system is rebooted and the crash file is still present it will not send another event.
    ##
    ## The Windows crash detection check uses data from the crash dump file to notify when the 
    ## crash occurred, and attempts to display which module caused the crash.
    -

    ## @param enabled - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Specify if the check should report Windows system crashes
    ## This requires system-probe.
    ## And this requires the enabled flag in the windows_crash_detection section
    ## of system-probe.yaml to be set to true.
    #
    # enabled: true

    ## @param tags - list of strings following the pattern: "key:value" - optional
