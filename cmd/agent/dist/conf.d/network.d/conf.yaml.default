## The Network check only supports one configured instance.

instances:

    ## @param collect_connection_state - boolean - required
    ## Set to true to collect connection states for your interfaces.
    #
  - collect_connection_state: false

    ## @param excluded_interfaces - list of strings - optional
    ## List of interfaces to exclude from the check.
    #
    # excluded_interfaces:
    #   - lo
    #   - lo0

    ## @param excluded_interface_re - string - optional
    ## Completely ignore any network interface matching the given regex.
    #
    # excluded_interface_re: <NETWORK_INTERFACE_NAME>.*

    ## @param combine_connection_states - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Set to false to prevent combination of connection states.
    ## By default, states like fin_wait_1 and fin_wait_2 are combined
    ## together into one state: 'closing' disables this option to get more granular data.
    #
    # combine_connection_states: true

    ## @param collect_rate_metrics - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## By default, most metrics are submitted as rates.
    ## However, some metrics like TCP/UDP retransmissions and errors are
    ## better handled as counts.
    ## Choose to disable rate metrics by setting collect_rate_metrics to false.
    #
    # collect_rate_metrics: true

    ## @param collect_count_metrics - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## By default, most metrics are submitted as rates.
    ## However, some metrics like TCP/UDP retransmissions and errors are
    ## better handled as counts.
    ## Choose to enable count metrics by setting collect_count_metrics to true.
    ## Count metrics have '.count' added to the metric name.
    #
    # collect_count_metrics: false

    ## @param whitelist_conntrack_metrics - list of strings - optional - default: ["max", "count"]
    ## Linux only.
    ## Names of the conntrack metrics to whitelist for monitoring. The metric value is in the file.
    ## /${proc}/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_${metric_name}.
    ## By default the Agent collects only max and count.
    ## Regex expressions for the project names are supported.
    ## Blacklist takes precedence over whitelist in case of overlap.
    #
    # whitelist_conntrack_metrics:
    #   - <METRIC_NAME>
    #   - <METRIC_PREFIX>*

    ## @param blacklist_conntrack_metrics - list of strings - optional - default: []
    ## Linux only.
    ## Names of the conntrack metrics to blacklist for monitoring. The metric value is in the file.
    ## /${proc}/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_${metric_name}.
    ## If set, whitelist default value is reset to [].
    ## Regex expressions for the project names are supported.
    ## Blacklist takes precedence over whitelist in case of overlap.
    #
    # blacklist_conntrack_metrics:
    #   - <METRIC_NAME>
    #   - <METRIC_PREFIX>*
