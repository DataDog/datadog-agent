init_config:

## Network check only supports one configured instance

instances:

    ## @param collect_connection_state - boolean - required
    ## Set to true to collect connection states for your interfaces
    #
  - collect_connection_state: false

    ## @param excluded_interfaces - list of strings - optional
    ## List of interface to exclude from the check.
    #
    # excluded_interfaces:
    #   - lo
    #   - lo0

    ## @param excluded_interface_re - string - optional
    ## Completely ignore any network interface matching the given regex.
    #
    # excluded_interface_re: <NETWORK_INTERFACE_NAME>.*

    ## @param combine_connection_states - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Set to false to not combine connection states.
    ## By default we combine states like fin_wait_1 and fin_wait_2
    ## together into one state: 'closing' disable this option to get more granular data.
    #
    # combine_connection_states: true

    ## @param collect_rate_metrics - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## By default, most metrics are submitted as rates.
    ## However, some metrics like tcp/udp retransmissions and errors are
    ## better handled as counts.
    ## Choose to disable rate metrics by setting collect_rate_metrics to false.
    #
    # collect_rate_metrics: true

    ## @param collect_count_metrics - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## By default, most metrics are submitted as rates.
    ## However, some metrics like tcp/udp retransmissions and errors are
    ## better handled as counts.
    ## Choose to enable count metrics by setting collect_count_metrics to true.
    ## Count metrics have '.count' added to the metric name.
    #
    # collect_count_metrics: false

    ## @param conntrack_path - string - optional
    ## Linux only.
    ## The location of the conntrack executable in order to get the stats from conntrack -S.
    ## It will be run with sudo, so an entry needs to be added to the sudoers file.
    ## By default, these metrics will not be sent.
    #
    # conntrack_path: /usr/sbin/conntrack

    ## @param whitelist_conntrack_metrics - list of string - optional - default: ["max", "count"]
    ## Linux only.
    ## Names of the conntrack metrics to whitelist for monitoring. The metric value is in the file
    ## /${proc}/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_${metric_name}.
    ## By default the agent collects only max and count.
    ## Regex expressions for the project names are supported.
    ## Blacklist takes precedence over whitelist in case of overlap.
    #
    # whitelist_conntrack_metrics:
    #   - <METRIC_NAME>
    #   - <METRIC_PREFIX>*

    ## @param blacklist_conntrack_metrics - list of strings - optional - default: []
    ## Linux only.
    ## Names of the conntrack metrics to blacklist for monitoring. The metric value is in the file
    ## /${proc}/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_${metric_name}.
    ## If set, whitelist default value is reset to []
    ## Regex expressions for the project names are supported.
    ## Blacklist takes precedence over whitelist in case of overlap.
    #
    # blacklist_conntrack_metrics:
    #   - <METRIC_NAME>
    #   - <METRIC_PREFIX>*

    ## @param tags - list of key:value elements - optional
    ## List of tags to attach to every metric, event and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
