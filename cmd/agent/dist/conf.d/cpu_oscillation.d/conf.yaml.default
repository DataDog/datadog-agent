## CPU Oscillation Detector
##
## Detects rapid CPU oscillation patterns that may indicate:
## - Restart loops
## - Thrashing systems
## - Retry storms
## - Misconfigured autoscaling
##
## This check samples CPU at 1Hz and analyzes the pattern for oscillations.
## Metrics are emitted every 15 seconds after a 60-second window fills.
## Detection is only possible after the warmup period (default 5 minutes).
##
## NOTE: This check is DISABLED by default. To enable it, uncomment the
## instances section below or configure via autodiscovery annotations.

## The CPU Oscillation check only supports one configured instance.
## Uncomment the instances section below to enable the check.

# instances:
#   -
#
#     ## @param amplitude_multiplier - float - optional - default: 4.0
#     ## The multiplier applied to the baseline standard deviation to determine
#     ## the amplitude threshold. Swings must exceed this threshold to be flagged.
#     ## Lower values = more sensitive (more detections, potentially more false positives)
#     ## Higher values = less sensitive (fewer detections, may miss real issues)
#     ## Valid range: 0.5 to 10.0
#     #
#     # amplitude_multiplier: 4.0
#
#     ## @param min_amplitude - float - optional - default: 0
#     ## Absolute minimum amplitude (in CPU percentage points) required to trigger
#     ## oscillation detection. This provides a floor independent of the baseline.
#     ## Set to 0 to disable (rely only on amplitude_multiplier).
#     ## Useful for filtering out low-CPU hosts where small absolute swings aren't actionable.
#     ## Valid range: 0 to 100
#     #
#     # min_amplitude: 0
#
#     ## @param warmup_seconds - integer - optional - default: 300
#     ## Initial learning period in seconds during which the check learns the
#     ## host's normal CPU variance without flagging oscillations.
#     ## Detection is disabled during this period.
#     ## Valid range: 60 to 1800 seconds (1 to 30 minutes)
#     #
#     # warmup_seconds: 300
