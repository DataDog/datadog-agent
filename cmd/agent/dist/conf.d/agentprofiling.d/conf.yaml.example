    ## @param memory_threshold - string - optional - default: "0"
    ## Set to either a size (e.g., 10MB) or an exact byte value (e.g., 10485760).
    ## When this check runs, it will check if the Core Agent's RSS memory usage is above this threshold.
    ## If the threshold is exceeded, the check will generate a flare with memory and CPU profiles.
    ## Flare generation can only be triggered once per Agent lifecycle.
    ##
    ## If this value is set to "0", the check will not run.
    #
    # memory_threshold: "0"

    ## @param cpu_threshold - integer - optional - default: 0
    ## Set to a percentage value. If the Core Agent's CPU usage exceeds this threshold when the check runs,
    ## a flare with memory and CPU profiles will be generated.
    ## Flare generation can only be triggered once per Agent lifecycle.
    ##
    ## If this value is set to 0, the check will not run.
    #
    # cpu_threshold: 0

    ## @param ticket_id - string - required - default: ""
    ## Set to a valid ticket ID. When a flare is generated, it will be sent to this ticket.
    ## If no ticket ID is specified or the flare fails to send to the specified ticket, the Agent will attempt to store the flare locally.
    #
    # ticket_id: ""

    ## @param user_email - string - required - default: ""
    ## Set to the email address associated with the ticket.
    ## If not specified, the Agent will be unable to associate the flare with the ticket.
    #
    # user_email: ""

    ## @param terminate_agent_on_threshold - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## When set to true, the agent process will be terminated after successfully generating a flare
    ## when memory or CPU thresholds are exceeded.
    ##
    ## WARNING: This will cause the agent to exit. Ensure your process manager is configured to restart
    ## the agent automatically. Use with caution.
    ##
    ## The agent will attempt graceful shutdown via SIGINT, allowing cleanup before exit. If signal
    ## delivery fails, it will fall back to immediate termination.
