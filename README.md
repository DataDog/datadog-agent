The Datadog Agent faithfully collects events and metrics and brings them to
[Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com) on your behalf so that you can do something
useful with your monitoring and performance data.

## Getting started

To build the Agent you need:
 * [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.8 or later.
 * Python 2.7 along with development libraries.
 * [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/installing.html), you can install it via
   `pip install invoke` or via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on OSX/macOS with
   `brew install invoke`.

Builds and tests are orchestrated with `invoke`, type `invoke --list` on a shell
to see the available tasks.

To start working on the Agent, you can build the `master` branch:

1. checkout the repo within your `$GOPATH`.
2. install the project's dependencies: `invoke deps`.
   Make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH` otherwise this step might fail.
3. build the whole project with `invoke agent.build --build-exclude=snmp`

Please refer to the [Agent Developer Guide](docs/dev/README.md) for more details.

## Run

To start the agent type `agent start` from the `bin/agent` folder, it will take
care of adjusting paths and run the binary in foreground.

You need to provide a valid API key, either through the config file or passing
the environment variable like:
```
DD_API_KEY=12345678990 ./bin/agent/agent
```

## Developing custom checks

Please refer to the [Checks](docs/dev/checks/README.md) documentation for more details about creating custom Go or Python checks.
