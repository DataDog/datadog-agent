# Datadog Agent

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=dbcee3f02b9c3fe5f142bfc5ecb735fdec34b643)](https://circleci.com/gh/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/master)

For more informations about the single components, see the README files for:
 * [Agent](cmd/agent/README.md)
 * [Dogstatsd](cmd/dogstatsd/README.md)

## Requirements
To build the project you need:
 * `go` 1.6+
 * `rake`
 * an `agent` version 5.x installed under `/opt/`

Some tests have specific requirements, see [System Tests](tests/README.md).

 We use `pkg-config` to make compilers and linkers aware of CPython. If you need to adjust the build for your specific configuration, add or edit the files within the `pkg-config` folder.

## Getting started
Binary distributions are not provided yet, to try out the Agent you can build the `master` branch:

1. checkout the repo within your `GOPATH`
2. install the project's dependencies: `rake deps`

   Make sure that `GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` otherwise this step might fail. Alternatively  you can
   install [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) manually on your system before running `rake deps`
3. build the project: `rake build` (use `rake build incremental=true` for incremental builds)

Build and tests are orchestrated by a `Rakefile`, write `rake -T` on a shell to see the available tasks.
If you're using the DogBox, ask `gimme` to provide a recent version of go, like:
```
eval "$(gimme 1.6.2)"
```
