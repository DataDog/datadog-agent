The present repository contains the source code of the Datadog Agent version 6,
**currently in beta**. Please refer to the [beta docs](docs/beta.md) for more
informations about the status of the project, the limitations and how to install
the latest version of the Agent.

**Note:** the source code of the **stable** Datadog Agent 5 is located in the
[dd-agent](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent) repository.

## Getting started

To build the Agent you need:
 * [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.9.2 or later.
 * Python 2.7 along with development libraries.
 * [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/installing.html), you can install it via
   `pip install invoke` or via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on OSX/macOS with
   `brew install pyinvoke`.

Builds and tests are orchestrated with `invoke`, type `invoke --list` on a shell
to see the available tasks.

To start working on the Agent, you can build the `master` branch:

1. checkout the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
2. cd into the project folder: `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
3. install project's dependencies: `invoke deps`.
   Make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH` otherwise this step might fail.
4. build the whole project with `invoke agent.build --build-exclude=snmp`

Please refer to the [Agent Developer Guide](docs/dev/README.md) for more details.

## Run

To start the agent type `agent start` from the `bin/agent` folder, it will take
care of adjusting paths and run the binary in foreground.

You need to provide a valid API key. You can either use the config file or
overwrite it with the environment variable like:
```
DD_API_KEY=12345678990 ./bin/agent/agent -c bin/agent/dist/datadog.yaml
```
