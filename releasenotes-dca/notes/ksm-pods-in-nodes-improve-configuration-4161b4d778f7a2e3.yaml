# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed an issue in the KSM check when it's configured with the option
    ``pod_collection_mode`` set to ``node_kubelet``. Previously, the check could
    fail to start if there was a timeout while contacting the API server. This
    issue has now been resolved.
