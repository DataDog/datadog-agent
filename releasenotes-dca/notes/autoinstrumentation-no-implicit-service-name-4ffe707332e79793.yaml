    The autoinstrumentation webhook will no longer choose a service name based on the name
    of the deployment.

    This would override a service name set in a Dockerfile with ``ENV DD_SERVICE``
    and caused issues. If you need to set the service name from via kubernetes, please see
    the `Unified Service Tagging <https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/unified_service_tagging>`
    documentation for alternative methods.
