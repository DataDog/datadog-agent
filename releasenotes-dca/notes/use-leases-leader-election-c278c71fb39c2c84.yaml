    Add support for leases in leader election which can be enabled by setting 
    ``leader_election_default_resource`` to ``leases``, available since Kubernetes 1.14. 
    If this parameter is empty then leader election automatically detects if leases
    are available and uses them.
    Set ``leader_election_default_resource`` to ``configmap`` on clusters running
    Kubernetes versions older than v1.14.
