# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    secrets were never rebalanced when the Cluster Agent was configured to not
    resolve check secrets (option ``secret_backend_skip_checks`` set to true).
