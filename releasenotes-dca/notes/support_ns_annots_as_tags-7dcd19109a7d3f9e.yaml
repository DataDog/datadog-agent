# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add support for `kubernetes_namespace_annotations_as_tags`.
    This new option is equivalent to the existing `kubernetes_namespace_labels_as_tags`, 
    but it considers namespace annotations instead of namespace labels.
    With this new option, users can enrich tagging based on namespace annotations.
