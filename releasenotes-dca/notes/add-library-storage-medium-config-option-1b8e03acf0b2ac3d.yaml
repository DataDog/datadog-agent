    A new configuration option has been added to control the library storage medium for the auto-instrumentation webhook. This
    will allow you to utilize a memory backed emptyDir for environments that are storage constrained. The default
    behavior is to use a disk backed emptyDir for library storage. To enable memory backed emptyDir, set the following
    configuration option for the cluster agent:
    ```yaml
    clusterAgent:
      env:
        - name: "DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_VOLUME_EMPTY_DIR_STORAGE_MEDIUM"
          value: "memory"
    ```
