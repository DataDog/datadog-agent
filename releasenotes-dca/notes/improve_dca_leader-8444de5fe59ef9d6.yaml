# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    When the cluster-agent is started with ``hostNetwork: true``, the leader election mechanism was using a node name instead of the pod name. This was breaking the “follower to leader” forwarding mechanism.
    This change introduce the ``DD_POD_NAME`` environment variable as a more reliable way to set the cluster-agent pod name. It is supposed to be filled by the Kubernetes downward API.
