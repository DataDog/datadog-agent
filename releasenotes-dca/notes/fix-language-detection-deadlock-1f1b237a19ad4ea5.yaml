# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed a deadlock in the Cluster Agent language detection handler that could cause
    event drops with the error "collector language-detection-follower dropped event(s)
    after 10s timeout". The fix releases the mutex before pushing events to workloadmeta
    to prevent blocking while holding the lock.
