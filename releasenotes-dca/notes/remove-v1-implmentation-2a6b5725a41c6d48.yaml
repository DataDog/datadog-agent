  - |
    This change removes support for v1 of the auto-instrumentation webhook used for Single Step Instrumentation. The v2
    implementation, which has been the default since Agent v7.57.0, is a drop-in replacement. This setting was never exposed
    in Helm or the Datadog Operator. If you previously set the DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_VERSION environment variable on
    the Cluster Agent, it is now ignored.

    If you use a private registry, add the `apm-inject` container to your registry before upgrading. No action is
    required for other users. For details on using private registries, see [Use a private container registry](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/automatic_instrumentation/single-step-apm/kubernetes/?tab=agentv764recommended#use-a-private-container-registry).
