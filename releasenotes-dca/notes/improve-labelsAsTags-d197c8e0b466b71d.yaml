# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Improves the `labelsAsTags` feature of the Kubernetes State Metrics core check by performing the transformations of characters ['/' , '-' , '.'] 
    to underscores ['_'] within the Datadog agent.  
    Previously users had to perform these conversions manually in order to discover the labels on their resources.
