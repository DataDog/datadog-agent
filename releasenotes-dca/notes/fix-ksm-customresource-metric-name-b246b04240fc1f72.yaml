# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    metrics were incorrectly named using the `kubernetes_state.customresource.<name>`
    pattern instead of the intended `kubernetes_state_customresource.<prefix>_<name>` format.
