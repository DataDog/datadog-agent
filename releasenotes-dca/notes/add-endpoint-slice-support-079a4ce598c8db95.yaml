# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

enhancements:
  - |
    Added support for EndpointSlices in the metadata controller. This feature,
    enabled by setting `kubernetesUseEndpointSlices` to `true`, resolves limitations
    of Endpoints resources, particularly for services with more than 1000 addresses.
    Must add `endpointslices` to DCA cluster role.
fixes:
  - |
    Resolved a bug where `kube_service` tags were not properly deleted when a
    service's ties to pods on a specific node were removed but the service itself
    was not deleted.
