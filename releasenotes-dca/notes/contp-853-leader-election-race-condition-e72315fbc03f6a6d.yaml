# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

fixes:

    Fixed an issue that caused some Datadog Cluster Agent replicas to restart
    during the first install.
  - |
    When using leases for leader election with the
    ``leader_election_default_resource`` option, the Datadog Cluster Agent no
    longer creates an unused config map.
