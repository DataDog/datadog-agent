# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    We collect namespaces in Kubernetes for Single Step Instrumentation. We need this information to utilize namespace
    labels for workload selection. However, we also use this information to generate pod security polices for restricted
    namespaces. This change fixes an issue where we would only collect namespace information when target based workload
    selection was utilized instead of collecting namespaces for all Single Step Instrumentation configurations.
