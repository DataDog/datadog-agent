# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The auto-instrumentation webhook no longer mutates the ``istio-proxy`` container.
    This fixes an issue with Kubernetes-native sidecars and the istio service mesh
    where a standard sidecar is moved to be the first init container by istio after it
    was mutated by auto-instrumentation.
