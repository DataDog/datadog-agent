# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    New LabelSelector Admission Controller settings have been introduced
    to improve the usability of the LabelSelector Admission Controller
    for both ValidatingAdmissionWebhook and MutatingAdmissionWebhook.
    The new settings are:
    - `admission_controller.validation.unlabelled` to allow
      unlabelled resources to be admitted for all webhooks.
    - `admission_controller.kubernetes_admission_events.unlabelled` to
      allow unlabelled resources to be admitted specifically for the
      Kubernetes Admission Events webhook.
    Precedence is given to the webhook-specific settings over the
    global settings.
