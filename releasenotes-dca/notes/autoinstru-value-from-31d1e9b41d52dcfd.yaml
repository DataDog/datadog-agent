# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    For workload selection in auto-instrumentation, users can now use the Kubernetes native ``valueFrom``
    as an alternative to ``value`` in ``ddTraceConfigs``. This enables dynamic, user-defined and label
   -based value propagation to the tracing SDKs, like ``DD_SERVICE``.
