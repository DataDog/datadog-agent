# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Kubernetes State Metrics (KSM) check can now be configured to collect
    pods from the Kubelet in node agents instead of collecting them from the API
    Server in the Cluster Agent or the Cluster check runners. This is useful in
    clusters with a large number of pods where emitting pod metrics from a
    single check instance can cause performance issues due to the large number
    of metrics emitted.
