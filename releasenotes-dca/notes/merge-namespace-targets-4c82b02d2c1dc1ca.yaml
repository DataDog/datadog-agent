    Customers using Single Step Instrumentation with target-based workload selection can now use language detection.
    Language detection greatly reduces startup time when all default libraries are configured for a target.

    A target is eligible for language detection if a target has no defined `ddTraceVersions` or if `ddTraceVersions`
    matches the default set of SDKs. Once a language has been determined for a deployment, subsequent deploys
    only use the SDKs necessary for the detected language.
fixes:

    There were several bugs for customers using Single Step Instrumentation with target-based workload selection, and
    also using local SDK injection. This change resolves an issue where if targets were defined, the Cluster Agent
    didn't respect the `admission.datadoghq.com/enabled` annotation or the `admission_controller.mutate_unlabelled`
    configuration option, and only respected the language annotations.
