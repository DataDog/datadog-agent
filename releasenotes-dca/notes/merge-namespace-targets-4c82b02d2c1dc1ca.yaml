    Customers using Single Step Instrumentation with target based workload selection can now use language detection.
    Language detection greatly reduces startup time when all default libraries are configured for a target. To enable
    this feature, set `language_detection.enabled` to `true`.

    A target is eligible for language detection if a target has no defined `ddTraceVersions` or if `ddTraceVersions`
    matches the default set of SDKs. Once a language has been determined for a deployment, a subsequent deploy will
    only use the SDKs necessary for the detected language.
fixes:

    There were several bugs for customers using Single Step Instrumentation with target based workload selection and
    also utilized Local SDK Injection. This change resolves an issue where if targets were defined, the cluster agent
    didn't respect the `admission.datadoghq.com/enabled` annotation or the `admission_controller.mutate_unlabelled`
    configuration option and only respected the language annotations.
