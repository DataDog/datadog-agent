# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added a new option for the Cluster Agent
    ("admission_controller.inject_config.type_socket_volumes") to specify that
    injected volumes should be of type "Socket". This option is disabled by
    default. When set to true, injected pods will not start until the Agent
    creates the DogstatsD and trace-agent sockets. This ensures no traces or
    DogstatsD metrics are lost, but it can cause the pod to wait if the Agent
    has issues creating the sockets.
