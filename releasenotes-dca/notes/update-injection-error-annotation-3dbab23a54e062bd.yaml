    When injection fails for Single Step Instrumentation due to constrained resources, we add an annotation to the pod
    with a reason for the error. This annotation now matches all other annotations the webhook writes to a pod spec
    by prefixing the annotation with `internal`. The full annotation is now: `internal.apm.datadoghq.com/injection-error`
