# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fix the ``Admission Controller``/``Webhooks info`` section of the cluster agent ``agent status`` output on Kubernetes 1.22+.
    Although the cluster agent was able to register its webhook with both the ``v1beta1`` and the ``v1`` version of the Administrationregistration API, the ``agent status`` command was always using the ``v1beta1``, which has been removed in Kubernetes 1.22.
