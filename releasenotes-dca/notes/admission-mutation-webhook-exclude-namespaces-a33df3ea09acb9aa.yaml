# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added namespace selectors excluding system namespace (``kube-system`` and the Datadog Agent's namespace)
    resources from Admission Controller mutation webhooks. This prevents mutation webhooks from unnecessarily
    intercepting system namespace resources, reducing misleading warnings or logs, and improving clarity
    about which resources are actually mutated.
