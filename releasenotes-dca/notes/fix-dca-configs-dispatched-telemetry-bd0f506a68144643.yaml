# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes an issue with the
    ``datadog.cluster_agent.cluster_checks.configs_dispatched`` metric emitted
    by the Cluster Agent telemetry. The metric values could become inaccurate
    after the Cluster Agent loses and then regains leader status.
