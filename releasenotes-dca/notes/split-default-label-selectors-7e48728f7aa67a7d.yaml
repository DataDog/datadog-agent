    The Datadog Cluster Agent's mutating webhooks (part of the [Admission Controller](https://docs.datadoghq.com/containers/cluster_agent/admission_controller/?tab=datadogoperator)) previously included Single Step Instrumentation (SSI) settings in their default webhook label selectors. These SSI-specific settings, `apm_config.instrumentation.enabled` and `apm_config.instrumentation.enabled_namespaces`, have been removed.

    For those using Single Step Instrumentation, no action is required and no behavior changes. For those using the `config` or `tagsfromlabels` webhooks for manually instrumented applications, behavior remains consistent with the [documented configuration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/containers/cluster_agent/admission_controller/?tab=datadogoperator#apm-and-dogstatsd). Users that were unintentionally relying on the SSI settings without using SSI should add the appropriate pod label or enable `mutate_unlabelled` to preserve the previous behavior.
