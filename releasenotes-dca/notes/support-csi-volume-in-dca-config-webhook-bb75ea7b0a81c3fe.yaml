# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    [BETA] Add support for mounting Datadog CSI Volumes instead of hostpath 
    volumes in the admission controller config webhook. This applies
    to mounting Dogstatsd and Tracing UDS sockets onto user applications.
    This requires datadog CSI driver to be installed and running on the cluster.
