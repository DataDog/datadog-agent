    A new configuration option has been added to control the library storage limit for the auto-instrumentation webhook.
    This will allow customers to set a limit for their emptyDir size. To enable limits for the SDK emptyDir, set the
    following configuration option for the Cluster Agent:

    ```yaml
    clusterAgent:
      env:
        - name: "DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_VOLUME_EMPTY_DIR_STORAGE_LIMIT"
          value: "100Mi"
    ```
