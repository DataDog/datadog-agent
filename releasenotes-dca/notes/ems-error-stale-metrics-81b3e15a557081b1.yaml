# Each section from every release note are combined when the

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixes issue where the external metrics server would sometimes return metrics which had not
    been updated for longer than the configured `external_metrics_provider.max_age` as valid.
    In connection with this fix, a new config (`external_metrics_provider.query_validity_period`)
    has been added to account for the delay between when metrics are resolved and when they
    are queried by the various autoscaling controllers. It is set to 30 seconds by default.
