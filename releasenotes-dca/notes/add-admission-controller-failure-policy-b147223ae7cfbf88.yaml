# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added a configuration option to admission controller to allow
    configuration of the failure policy. Defaults to Ignore which
    was the previous default. The default of Ignore means that pods
    will still be admitted even if the webhook is unavailable to
    inject them. Setting to Fail will require the admission controller
    to be present and pods to be injected before they are allowed to run.
