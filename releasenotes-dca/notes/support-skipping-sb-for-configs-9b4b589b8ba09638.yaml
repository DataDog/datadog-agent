    The Cluster Agent can be instructed to dispatch cluster checks without decrypting secrets.
    The node Agent or the cluster check runner will fetch the secrets after receiving the configurations from the Cluster Agent.
    This can be enabled by setting ``DD_SECRET_BACKEND_SKIP_CHECKS`` to ``true`` in the Cluster Agent config.
