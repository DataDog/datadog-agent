# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add KSM Resource Type Sharding for improved performance in large Kubernetes clusters.
    This feature automatically splits the ``kubernetes_state_core`` check into multiple
    shards based on resource type groups (pods, nodes, others), enabling parallel execution
    across multiple Cluster Check Runners.
