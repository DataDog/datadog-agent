# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Add APM tracing instrumentation to the Datadog Cluster Agent for improved observability
    and debugging in production environments. When enabled, the Cluster Agent emits APM traces
    for cluster check dispatching and rebalancing operations, surfacing patch failures and
    rebalancing decisions as span tags.
