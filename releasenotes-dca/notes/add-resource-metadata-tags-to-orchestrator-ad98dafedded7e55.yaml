    Added support for `kubernetesResourcesLabelsAsTags` and `kubernetesResourcesAnnotationsAsTags` in the
    orchestrator check. Kubernetes resources processed by the orchestrator check can now include labels 
    and annotations as tags, improving consistency with existing tagging configurations.
