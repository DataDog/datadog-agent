# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG-DCA.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    The Cluster Agent is now able to delete `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` and `MutatingAdmissionWebhook`
    depending on the `admission_controller.validation.enabled` and `admission_controller.mutation.enabled` settings.
    Note that `admission_controller.enabled` must be set to `true` to allow the Cluster Agent to
    interact with the Kubernetes Admission Controller.
