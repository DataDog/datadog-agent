# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

features:

    Added support for gradual rollout in K8s SSI deployments.
    This feature is enabled if the following conditions are met:
    - ``DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true`` and/or ``DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true``
    - Remote config is enabled in the organization
    - Using the `gcr.io/datadoghq` registry
    This gradually rolls out access to new injector and tracer library releases to subsets of customers, with the ability to pause if issues are detected.
