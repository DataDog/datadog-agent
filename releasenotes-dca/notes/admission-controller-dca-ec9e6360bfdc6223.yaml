    The Cluster Agent now provides a Kubernetes Admission Controller to inject 'DD_AGENT_HOST'
    and 'DD_ENTITY_ID' into Dogstasd clients and APM tracers automatically.
    The Admission Controller can also inject the standard tags (env, service, version)
    as environment variables from object labels 'tags.datadoghq.com/'.
