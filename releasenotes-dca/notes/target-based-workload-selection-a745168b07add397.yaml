# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Target-based workload selection is now available for Single Step Instrumentation. This feature enables you to
    instrument specific workloads using pod and namespace label selectors. By applying user-defined labels, you can
    select workloads for instrumentation without modifying applications. For example, the following configuration
    injects the Python tracer with a default version for pods labeled with `language=python`:
    ```yaml
    instrumentation:
      enabled: true
      targets:
        - name: "Python Services"
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              language: "python"
          ddTraceVersions:
            python: "default"
    ```

    Targets can also be chained together, with the first matching rule taking precedence. For example, the following
    configuration installs the Python tracer for pods labeled `language=python` and the Java tracer for pods in a
    namespace labeled `language=java`. If a pod matches both rules, the first match takes precedence:
    ```
    instrumentation:
      enabled: true
      targets:
        - name: "Python Services"
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              language: "python"
          ddTraceVersions:
            python: "default"
        - name: "Java Namespaces"
          namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              language: "java"
          ddTraceVersions:
            python: "default"
    ```

    Targets support tracer configuration options in the form of environment variables. All options must have the
    `DD_` prefix. The following example installs the Python tracer with profiling and data jobs enabled:
    ```
    instrumentation:
      enabled: true
      targets:
        - name: "Python Apps"
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              language: "python"
          ddTraceVersions:
            python: "v2"
          ddTraceConfigs:
            - name: "DD_PROFILING_ENABLED"
              value: "true"
            - name: "DD_DATA_JOBS_ENABLED"
              value: "true"
    ```
