# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Fixed a bug in the advanced dispatching of cluster checks. All the checks
    scheduled since the last rebalance were being scheduled in the same node.
    Now they should be distributed among the available nodes.
