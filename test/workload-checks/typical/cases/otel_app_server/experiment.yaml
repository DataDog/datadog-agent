  Simulates a relatively busy application server on which DogStatsD metrics,
  OTeL traces and TCP streamed logs are present on which the client user has
  mostly transitioned to the use of OTeL over DogStatsD and TCP listener logs,
  although not entirely replacing these sources of metrics and logs. Traces
  represent the majority of load. We make claims about throughput, UDS packet
  loss and memory, CPU resource consumption.
