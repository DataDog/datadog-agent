# Application Server

## Purpose

Demonstrates an Agent configuration typical of one deployed on an application
server.

## Notes

The purpose above is not quite true. I'm fully guessing at what the 'normal'
Agent configuration for such a situation would be like. Instead we're
demonstrating a situation where Agent has two components flipped on and lading
produces load into both.
