description: >
  Simulates a relatively busy application server on which DogStatsD metrics,
  traces and TCP streamed logs are present on which the client user is
  interested in OTeL but has not made a complete transition. DogStatsD, TCP logs,
  and APM traces make up the load. We make claims about throughput, UDS packet
  loss and memory, CPU resource consumption.
