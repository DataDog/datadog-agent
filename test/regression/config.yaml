# Link templates for reports.
#
# Values may be removed to disable corresponding links in reports.
#
# Links that may be set:
# - `metrics_dashboard`: link to a metrics dashboard
# - `profiles`: link to profiles
# - `per_experiment_logs`: link to logs, for each experiment
#
# Additionally, arbitrary links may be added to experiment configuration files.
# These should be added as a list of key-value pairs in a 'report_links'
# section. For example:
# ```
# report_links:
#   - text: Link Text
#     link: "link template"
# ```
#
# Available variables:
# - `job_id`: the job ID
# - `start_time_ms`: start time of the job's metrics data, in ms
# - `end_time_ms`: end time of the job's metrics data, in ms
# - `filter_start`: arbitrary time before this job's replicates were run,
#   suitable for filtering logs and profiles by job ID.
# - `filter_end`: arbitrary time after this job's replicates were run and logs
#   were uploaded, suitable for filtering logs and profiles by job ID.
#
# Additional variables for per-experiment links:
# - `experiment`: the name of the experiment
