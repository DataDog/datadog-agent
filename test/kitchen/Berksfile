cookbook 'datadog', '~> 4.0.0'

# We pin an old version of the apt cookbook because this cookbook triggers an "apt update" by default
# and in newer versions this update is not allowed to fail, while in 3.X it is. For some reason
# apt update fails a lot in our debian instances.
# This can be removed if the datadog cookbook no longer depends on apt, since it's only used there
# (ie: when the datadog cookbook requires chef >= 13.3, which already bundles everything we use from apt).
