## dd-agent-no-subservices.md

### Objective

Test the Windows command line installer options for explicitly disabling the various datadog subservices (processes, trace, and logs)

### Installation Recipe

Uses the \_install_windows_base recipe to do a fresh install of the agent.
1. Uses a fresh install because install options are ignored on upgrades
2. Uses the \_base recipe which allows setting of additional options
