Tags mentioned in notify_by must be a subset of the grouping tags in the query. For example, a query grouped by cluster and namespace cannot notify on region. Setting notify_by to [*] configures the monitor to notify as a simple-alert.

For monitors using Count queries, an empty monitor evaluation is treated as 0 and is compared to the threshold conditions. For monitors using any query type other than Count, for example Gauge, Measure, or Rate, the monitor shows the last known status. This option is only available for APM Trace Analytics, Audit Trail, CI, Error Tracking, Event, Logs, and RUM monitors
