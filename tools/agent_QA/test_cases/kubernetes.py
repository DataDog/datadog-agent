Deploy agent on K8s.

Deploy a pod using K8s AD annotations to enable logs collection: https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/onboarding/container

Check if annotation works on its own, and with container_collect_all enabled, exclusion, and few corner cases (see checklist)

Example setup: https://github.com/DataDog/croissant-integration-resources/tree/master/logs-agent/qa/kubernetes/ad-pod-annotations 

- [k8s+docker] All logs from all containers are collected when `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_CONTAINER_COLLECT_ALL=true` set.
- [k8s+docker] All logs are properly tagged with container metadata
- [k8s+docker] Check that the `DD_CONTAINER_EXCLUDE` works properly
- [k8s+docker] Check that the agent survives a corrupted log
- [k8s+docker] Only containers with tags are collected when `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_CONTAINER_COLLECT_ALL` is not set
- [k8s+docker] Check that lines longer than 16kB are supported and show up intact in the explorer
