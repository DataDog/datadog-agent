# check_deploy stage
# Contains jobs which check if the version of the Agent built in the pipeline
# already exists (in the apt staging repo), or if the release branch is "none".
# In both cases, these jobs fail in order to prevent the pipeline from deploying artifacts.

# Check that the current version hasn't already been deployed (we don't want to
# overwrite a public package). To update an erroneous package, first remove it
# from our S3 bucket.
