# trigger_release stage
# Contains jobs which trigger release pipelines in the datadog/agent-release-management repository.

# The trigger jobs are always run (even on failing pipelines)
# because there's no way to retry a trigger job once it gets skipped
# because of a pipeline failure, even when retrying the pipeline.
