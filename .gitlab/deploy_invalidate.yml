# deploy_invalidate stage
# Contains jobs which automatically invalidate Cloudfront distributions when packages are deployed
# to the staging repsositories.

#
# Cloudfront cache invalidation:
# Duplicated in 2 jobs: one that runs "on success" of the previous stage, and one that runs "on failure" of previous stages.
# Compared to having 1 single job that runs "always", this setup guarantees that if earlier stages first failed and were
# then retried successfully, the cloudfront invalidation will also run after the successful retry.
