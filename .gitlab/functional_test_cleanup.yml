# functional_test_cleanup stage
# Contains a job which cleans up kitchen resources created for functional tests.

# FIXME: our current Gitlab version doesn't support importing a file more than once
# For now, the workaround is to include "common" files once in the top-level .gitlab-ci.yml file
# See: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28987
# include:
#   - /.gitlab/kitchen_common/cleanup.yml
